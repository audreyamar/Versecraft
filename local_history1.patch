+Abuse
+He was little at the time,
+She was only a child,
+But both were abused,
+And had been for a while.
+Their father was cruel,
+Mean and heartless.
+The way he hurt them,
+Made it look effortless.
+He locked her up,
+In a room up the stair.
+And left the house drunk,
+Leaving her there.
+He was hit from the mum,
+A blow to the face.
+The way they were treated,
+Was an utter disgrace.
+He couldn't get up,
+He couldn't fight back.
+For food to get stronger,
+Was something he lacked.
+The little girl was left,
+Alone in the dark.
+Cradling her arm,
+On which was a mark.
+Her wrist had been used,
+To put out a cigarette stump.
+Buring through the skin,
+Leaving her with a lump.
+He had been kicked,
+When he was down.
+Kicked for just being there,
+Kicked down to the ground.
+She had been someone,
+For her parents alone,
+To personally hurt,
+When they were at home.
+These children were hurt,
+Outside and in.
+They'd been physically abused,
+And hurt right within.
+Their pride had been banished,
+Long, long ago.
+They couldn't stand up,
+And simply say, 'No! '
+The children died,
+Not older than three.
+The boy protecting his sister,
+The girl clutching her teddy.
+They had bruises,
+Up and down their arms.
+But they had escaped,
+Escaped from further harm.
+I wish that I could have,
+Had the courage to speak.
+To tell someone of this abuse,
+That happened each week.
+I could have made a difference,
+For this little boy and girl,
+I could have made a difference,
+That they could mean the whole world.
+So if you know of any,
+Type of abuse.
+Tell the helpline to today,
+Before someones life is what we loose.

+Krishna, her dream husband.
+So, she wasn’t at all worried.
+They sent messengers
+To other Rajput kings

+None came forward

+Meera was quite upset,

+“I can’t break our tradition

+Already when I’m married
+To Krishna, my husband.”
+Her mother cried and said,
+“My life I would have laid
+With your father in the pyre,
+You know, why I’m here.”
+“Because of you I’m alive.
+If today your father is alive,
+He would’ve had it done
+To our utmost satisfaction.”
+“What’s not possible now,
+After it you run how?
+Of what’s possible,
+Why can’t you now avail? ”
+”Our Rajput tradition says
+A grown up girl, who marries
+Should serve her husband,
+And die with her husband.”
+Meera gave deaf ears.
+She cried and shed tears.
+They came to the conclusion
+That Meera had gone sick then.
+Doctors came to check
+But they went back
+Without giving any treatment,
+Not knowing her ailment.
+Meera’s eyes became red
+As she cried and cried.
+Her mother was upset
+O’er her pitiable sight.
+Till the last moment
+Poor Meera did expect
+Krishna would save her
+But He disappointed her.
+Here and there people walked.
+About the marriage they talked.
+Kumbha Rana arrived in the scene.
+It was her marriage day one.
+As a bride, Meera was decorated.
+In Rajput style, she was dressed.
+But Meera was in tears.
+Her face showed fears.
+Her mother said, “Meera, listen
+It’s our prestige, not a fun,
+Our two kingdoms, it’ll strengthen.
+Rajput clan will glow and shine.”
+“A mother is the first Goddess.
+Next only your Krishna comes.
+I’m your mother saying this.
+Be bold, happy and wise.”
+Meera replied, “Yes, mother
+Now I obey your order
+As your way is Krishna’s way.
+Your word is His word this day.”
+She spoke no more words.
+She stepped on the dais
+To hold the second hand
+And accept her new husband.

+Epilogue to 'A Vision'
+MIDNIGHT has come, and the great Christ Church Bell
+And may a lesser bell sound through the room;
+And it is All Souls' Night,
+And two long glasses brimmed with muscatel
+Bubble upon the table.  A ghost may come;
+For it is a ghost's right,
+His element is so fine
+Being sharpened by his death,
+To drink from the wine-breath
+While our gross palates drink from the whole wine.
+I need some mind that, if the cannon sound
+From every quarter of the world, can stay
+Wound in mind's pondering
+As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound;
+Because I have a marvellous thing to say,
+A certain marvellous thing
+None but the living mock,
+Though not for sober ear;
+It may be all that hear
+Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.
+Horton's the first I call.  He loved strange thought
+And knew that sweet extremity of pride
+That's called platonic love,
+And that to such a pitch of passion wrought
+Nothing could bring him, when his lady died,
+Anodyne for his love.
+Words were but wasted breath;
+One dear hope had he:
+The inclemency
+Of that or the next winter would be death.
+Two thoughts were so mixed up I could not tell
+Whether of her or God he thought the most,
+But think that his mind's eye,
+When upward turned, on one sole image fell;
+And that a slight companionable ghost,
+Wild with divinity,
+Had so lit up the whole
+Immense miraculous house
+The Bible promised us,
+It seemed a gold-fish swimming in a bowl.
+On Florence Emery I call the next,
+Who finding the first wrinkles on a face
+Admired and beautiful,
+And knowing that the future would be vexed
+With 'minished beauty, multiplied commonplace,
+preferred to teach a school
+Away from neighbour or friend,
+Among dark skins, and there
+permit foul years to wear
+Hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end.
+Before that end much had she ravelled out
+From a discourse in figurative speech
+By some learned Indian
+On the soul's journey.  How it is whirled about,
+Wherever the orbit of the moon can reach,
+Until it plunge into the sun;
+And there, free and yet fast,
+Being both Chance and Choice,
+Forget its broken toys
+And sink into its own delight at last.
+And I call up MacGregor from the grave,
+For in my first hard springtime we were friends.
+Although of late estranged.
+I thought him half a lunatic, half knave,
+And told him so, but friendship never ends;
+And what if mind seem changed,
+And it seem changed with the mind,
+When thoughts rise up unbid
+On generous things that he did
+And I grow half contented to be blind!
+He had much industry at setting out,
+Much boisterous courage, before loneliness
+Had driven him crazed;
+For meditations upon unknown thought
+Make human intercourse grow less and less;
+They are neither paid nor praised.
+but he d object to the host,
+The glass because my glass;
+A ghost-lover he was
+And may have grown more arrogant being a ghost.
+But names are nothing.  What matter who it be,
+So that his elements have grown so fine
+The fume of muscatel
+Can give his sharpened palate ecstasy
+No living man can drink from the whole wine.
+I have mummy truths to tell
+Whereat the living mock,
+Though not for sober ear,
+For maybe all that hear
+Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.
+Such thought -- such thought have I that hold it tight
+Till meditation master all its parts,
+Nothing can stay my glance
+Until that glance run in the world's despite
+To where the damned have howled away their hearts,
+And where the blessed dance;
+Such thought, that in it bound
+I need no other thing,
+Wound in mind's wandering
+As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound.

+It was a little budding rose,
+Round like a fairy globe,
+And shyly did its leaves unclose
+Hid in their mossy robe,
+But sweet was the slight and spicy smell
+It breathed from its heart invisible.
+The rose is blasted, withered, blighted,
+Its root has felt a worm,
+And like a heart beloved and slighted,
+Failed, faded, shrunk its form.
+Bud of beauty, bonnie flower,
+I stole thee from thy natal bower.
+I was the worm that withered thee,
+Thy tears of dew all fell for me;
+Leaf and stalk and rose are gone,
+Exile earth they died upon.
+Yes, that last breath of balmy scent
+With alien breezes sadly blent!

+While their coaches give pep talk and say
+If you do well, you will get more
+The athletes flex their muscles
+Just to warm up before the race
+And to make sure they don’t fall asleep
+They sometimes slap their face
+The field referee blows the whistle and
+“On your mark, get set go”, he screams
+All eyes are on the athletes
+No one dare dreams
+There are races, javelin throw
+High jump and long jump too
+And even an event called shot put
+That’ll certainly amaze you
+So, sit back, and enjoy
+As the athletes speed through the events fast
+And I assure you these memories
+Your whole life will last.

+Now - our home is extremely lonesome
+Since my son went away.
+Although the sun is shining,
+The sky seems dull and gray.
+The room that he once occupied
+And tended with diligent care,
+Has sort of lost its luster,
+But the remnants of his youth are still there.
+During his formative years and more
+He'd been living at my side.
+I can see him standing near me,
+My heart filled with the utmost pride.
+Seemed as if some timid apparition
+Had come strolling toward me,
+And I clasped it close and hugged it,
+Elated and proud as I could be.
+Oh, the sound of his voice and laughter,
+Oh, the sparkle in his eyes,
+Full of joy, eagerness, and confidence,
+How those youth years went slipping by?
+Somehow - the thought of his demise
+Never came to him or me.
+I always prayed for his safety in a war
+In a land far across the sea.
+So, I know amid the realm of our community,
+Of our household so thoughtful and fair,
+My son's soul is beckoning me,
+I can hear it everywhere,
+In the stillness and in the darkness,
+As about the house I roam,
+The melancholy voice is always the same,
+' I'm coming mom, I'm coming home.'

+Dear Lord in heaven, this has been a very interesting week, still so much to learn and so much to be forgiven for.  Although Lord verbally we have not offended anyone but inwardly sometimes we have feelings of jealousy or envy.  These feelings truly are negative feelings and need to be dealt with.  Today Lord I pray that you rid our minds of such thoughts and replace those thoughts with grateful thoughts.  Show us how to look at things in a different light, to see what is important and not to focus on the material things in life but to realize that we were all given gifts and those gifts are to be treasured, respected and shared with others.
+Father when others copy us, let us realize that this is a compliment, which shows that we  have the ability to set the trend, to take the lead and to move forward allowing others to follow and create a much brighter environment.
+Father when others speak badly of us because they are feeling jealous of us, teach us not to react in a negative manner but to continue to hold on to the positive not allowing such words to hurt us.  Hold our hands a little tighter Lord.
+Father, teach us to be humble and to always put you first, always have you at the head of our tables, present in our midst, clear in our thoughts, forever under your umbrella and Lord teach us to always listen to the whispers.
+I thank you Father for all that you have done for me and I share this prayer with my brothers and sisters on poemhunter in the hope that they will find something here that may be of help to them.
+I ask you Lord for forgiveness, I ask you to keep us out of harms way, I ask that you continue to walk with us, stand by us and to carry us when we can no longer walk.
+Lord in the name of your son Jesus, I thank you, I love you, I respect you, I know you and I will always worship you.
+Amen

+GLOUCESTER, AUGUST, 1720
+The wind it wailed, the wind it moaned,
+And the white caps flecked the sea;
+"An' I would to God," the skipper groaned,
+"I had not my boy with me!
+Snug in the stern-sheets, little John
+Laughed as the scud swept by;
+But the skipper's sunburnt cheeks grew wan
+As he watched the wicked sky.
+"Would he were at his mother's side!"
+And the skipper's eyes were dim.
+"Good Lord in heaven, if ill betide,
+What would become of him!
+"For me--my muscles are as steel,
+For me let hap what may;
+I might make shift upon the keel
+Until the break o' day.
+"But he, he is so weak and small,
+So young, scarce learned to stand--
+O pitying Father of us all,
+I trust him in Thy hand!
+"For Thou, who makest from on high
+A sparrow's fall--each one!--
+Surely, O Lord, thou'lt have an eye
+On Alec Yeaton's son!"
+Then, helm hard-port; right straight he sailed
+Towards the headland light:
+The wind it moaned, the wind it wailed,
+And black, black fell the night.
+Then burst a storm to make one quail
+Though housed from winds and waves--
+They who could tell about that gale
+Must rise from watery graves!
+Sudden it came, as sudden went;
+Ere half the night was sped,
+The winds were hushed, the waves were spent,
+And the stars shone overhead.
+Now, as the morning mist grew thin,
+The folk on Gloucester shore
+Saw a little figure floating in
+Secure, on a broken oar!
+Up rose the cry, "A wreck! a wreck!
+Pull, mates, and waste no breath!"--
+They knew it, though 't was but a speck
+Upon the edge of death!
+Long did they marvel in the town
+At God his strange decree,
+That let the stalwart skipper drown
+And the little child go free!

+Amidst their dimness, and a fitful sound

+Lay the oak shadows o'er the turf, so still

+A tale of Palestine. Meanwhile the bee
+Swept past me with a tone of summer hours,
+A drowsy bugle, wafting thoughts of flowers,
+Blue skies, and amber sunshine: brightly free,
+On filmy wings the purple dragon-fly
+Shot glancing like a fairy javelin by;
+And a sweet voice of sorrow told the dell
+Where sat the lone wood-pigeon:
+But ere long,
+All sense of these things faded, as the spell
+Breathing from that high gorgeous tale grew strong

+Singing in secret thro' its grassy glen;
+A wild shrill trumpet of the Saracen
+Peal'd from the desert's lonely heart, and shook

+Shadow'd by graceful palm-trees. Then the shout
+Of merry England's joy swell'd freely out,
+Sent thro' an eastern heaven, whose glorious hue
+Made shields dark mirrors to its depths of blue:
+And harps were there; I heard their sounding strings,
+As the waste echoed to the mirth of kings.
+The bright masque faded. Unto life's worn track,
+What call'd me from its flood of glory, back?
+A voice of happy childhood! and they pass'd,

+Ye sons of Mars, come list to me,
+And I will relate to ye
+A great and heroic naval fight,
+Which will fill your hearts with delight.
+The fight was between the French Frigate "Pique" and the British Frigate "Blanche,"
+But the British crew were bold and staunch;
+And the battle was fought in West Indian waters in the year of 1795,
+And for to gain the victory the French did nobly strive.
+And on the morning of the 4th of January while cruising off Gadulope,
+The look-out man from the foretop loudly spoke,
+And cried, "Sail ahoy!" "Where away ?"
+"On the lee bow, close in shore, sir," was answered without delay.
+Then Captain Faulkner cried, "Clear the decks!"
+And the French vessel with his eyeglass he inspects;
+And he told his men to hoist the British flag,
+And "prepare my heroes to pull down that French rag."
+Then the "Blanche" made sail and bore away
+In the direction of the "Pique" without delay;
+And Captain Fauikner cried, "Now, my lads, bear down on him,
+And make ready quickly and begin."
+It was about midnight when the Frenchman hove in sight,
+And could be seen distinctly in the starlight;
+And for an hour and a half they fired away
+Broadsides into each other without dismay.
+And with tne rapid flashes the Heavens were aflame,
+As each volley from the roaring cannons came;
+And the incessant roll of musketry was awful to hear,
+As it broke over the silent sea and smote upon the ear.
+The French vessel had nearly 400 men,
+Her decks were literally crowded from stem to stern;
+And the musketeers kept up a fierce fire on the " Blanche,"
+But still the "Blanche" on them did advance.
+And the "Blanche's" crew without dismay
+Fired a broadside into the "Pique" without delay,
+Which raked her fore and aft, and knocked her to smash,
+And the mizzen mast fell overboard with a terrible crash.
+Then the Frenohmen rushed forward to board the "Blanche,"
+But in doing so they had a very poor chance,
+For the British Tars in courage didn't lack,
+Because thrice in succession on their own deck they were driven back.
+Then "Brave, my lads!" Captain Faulkner loudly cries,
+"Lash her bowsprit to our capstan, she's our prize";
+And he seized some ropes to lash round his foe,
+But a musket ball pierced his heart and laid him low.
+Then a yell of rage burst from the noble crew,
+And near to his fallen body they drew;
+And tears for his loss fell fast on the deck,
+Their grief was so great their tears they conldn 't check.
+The crew was very sorry for their captain's downfall,
+But the sight didn't their brave hearts appall;
+Because they fastened the ropes to the "Pique" at the capstan,
+And the "Pique" was dragged after the "Blanche," the sight was grand.
+Yet the crew of the "Pique" maintained the fight,
+Oh! most courageously they fought in the dead of night;
+And for two hours they kept up firing without dismay,
+But it was a sacrifice of human life, they had to give way.
+And about five o'clock in the morning the French cried for quarter,
+Because on board there had been a great slaughter;
+Their Captain Consail was mortally wounded in the fight
+Along with many officers and men; oh! it was a heartrending sight
+To see the wounded and dead weltering in their gore

+On a sunny brae, alone I lay
+One summer afternoon;
+It was the marriage-time of May
+With her young lover, June.
+From her mother's heart, seemed loath to part
+That queen of bridal charms,
+But her father smiled on the fairest child
+He ever held in his arms.
+The trees did wave their plumy crests,
+The glad birds caroled clear;
+And I, of all the wedding guests,
+Was only sullen there!
+There was not one, but wished to shun
+My aspect void of cheer;
+The very grey rocks, looking on,
+Asked, "What do you here?"
+And I could utter no reply;
+In sooth, I did not know
+Why I had brought a clouded eye
+To greet the general glow.
+So, resting on a heathy bank,
+I took my heart to me;
+And we together sadly sank
+Into a reverie.
+We thought, "When winter comes again,
+Where will these bright things be?
+All vanished, like a vision vain,
+An unreal mockery!
+The birds that now so blithely sing,
+Through deserts, frozen dry,
+Poor spectres of the perished spring,
+In famished troops, will fly.
+And why should we be glad at all?
+The leaf is hardly green,
+Before a token of its fall
+Is on the surface seen!"
+Now, whether it were really so,
+I never could be sure;
+But as in fit of peevish woe,
+I stretched me on the moor.
+A thousand thousand gleaming fires
+Seemed kindling in the air;
+A thousand thousand silvery lyres
+Resounded far and near:
+Methought, the very breath I breathed
+Was full of sparks divine,
+And all my heather-couch was wreathed
+By that celestial shine!
+And, while the wide earth echoing rung
+To their strange minstrelsy,
+The little glittering spirits sung,
+Or seemed to sing, to me.
+"O mortal! mortal! let them die;
+Let time and tears destroy,
+That we may overflow the sky
+With universal joy!
+Let grief distract the sufferer's breast,
+And night obscure his way;
+They hasten him to endless rest,
+And everlasting day.
+To thee the world is like a tomb,
+A desert's naked shore;
+To us, in unimagined bloom,
+It brightens more and more!
+And could we lift the veil, and give
+One brief glimpse to thine eye,
+Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live,
+Because they live to die."
+The music ceased; the noonday dream,
+Like dream of night, withdrew;
+But Fancy, still, will sometimes deem
+Her fond creation true.

+Father today I come to you with a heavy heart, a heart that is saddened and crying out for your help.  Father this week a family is in great pain, for they have lost a loved one in such a brutal way.  A hard working woman of 40 years old, walking home from work, minding her own business, but she didn’t make it Lord.  No my Father, she didn’t make it, she was followed, beaten, raped and murdered.   A mother of 5 sons, working hard to save money to send  to the Philipines for her sons and husband to come to Canada to  live a better life.   Oh Father, now she ‘s not here any longer, taken by a ruthless, heartless killer.
+I’m told Father that I should pray for this killer, forgive  me my King, this I can not do.  Maybe another time perhaps, another day when I can think clearly.  Today I focus my prayers on the deceased woman and her precious family.
+The pain will be heavy and hard to deal with  but with your help Father anything is possible.  Please Lord put the blood of Jesus over them and give them the strength they need to move forward.  Father over these next few days and weeks, their eyes will fill with tears, their minds filled with questions asking why did this happen.  Only you can pull them through Lord, only you have the answers, only you can soothe them and give them your heavenly love.
+Father the perpetrator beat this poor lady so bad, that the family couldn’t indentify her so it would definitely appear that she suffered tremendously.  Father I want to believe that you took her to be with you long before the brutal blows were landed, that she was already sitting by your side.
+Yes Father, I’m troubled and having a very difficult time trying to understand this.  Why Lord, please talk to me so that I can understand why a young fellow like this, at the age of 21 could be so evil.  Lord I pray that you accept Arcelie into your kingdom, so that she will walk with you and enjoy the freedom of everlasting life.  I know that she is in your hands now Lord and that you will take good care of her.
+Father God I ask that you give the family strength to carry on with their lives and I thank you Father  for those that came forward and offered help in a financial way.  I ask Lord that you impress on the minds of those than can afford to give in a generous way, that this situation could happen to anyone, no one is an exception.   Father please help the family to keep all the little children under one roof, I pray that they never be separated.
+Lord for the family members that had to view the body and see the after effects of the brutaliy, oh Lord please help them to overcome Lord.  Help them to take that picture out of their minds and remember how beautiful  Arcelie   was.
+Father, wrap your arms around this family, hold them close, don’t let their minds wonder, keep them  focused on what they have to do and Lord please keep them out-of-harms way.
+Written:  Jan 27/2008
+Note:
+It is crucial that you realize every word of this is true.  In fact  it happened a little over a week ago, here in Calgary, Alberta.  Poemhunters please pray for Arcelie and her family, prayers are powerful and right now Arcelie’s family needs your prayers.

+holds us back from his space, the hollow he makes about him

+and uniforms back in the crowd who tried to seize him
+stare out at him, and feel, with amazement, their minds

+and shake as she receives the gift of weeping;
+as many as follow her also receive it
+and many weep for sheer acceptance, and more
+refuse to weep for fear of all acceptance,
+but the weeping man, like the earth, requires nothing,
+the man who weeps ignores us, and cries out
+of his writhen face and ordinary body
+not words, but grief, not messages, but sorrow,
+hard as the earth, sheer, present as the sea -
+and when he stops, he simply walks between us
+mopping his face with the dignity of one

+The sorrow of riverside blossoms inexplicable,
+And nowhere to complain -- I've gone half crazy.
+I look up our southern neighbor. But my friend in wine
+Gone ten days drinking. I find only an empty bed.
+A thick frenzy of blossoms shrouding the riverside,
+I stroll, listing dangerously, in full fear of spring.
+Poems, wine -- even this profusely driven, I endure.
+Arrangements for this old, white-haired man can wait.
+A deep river, two or three houses in bamboo quiet,
+And such goings on: red blossoms glaring with white!
+Among spring's vociferous glories, I too have my place:
+With a lovely wine, bidding life's affairs bon voyage.
+Looking east to Shao, its smoke filled with blossoms,
+I admire that stately Po-hua wineshop even more.
+To empty golden wine cups, calling such beautiful
+Dancing girls to embroidered mats -- who could bear it?
+East of the river, before Abbot Huang's grave,
+Spring is a frail splendor among gentle breezes.
+In this crush of peach blossoms opening ownerless,
+Shall I treasure light reds, or treasure them dark?
+At Madame Huang's house, blossoms fill the paths:
+Thousands, tens of thousands haul the branches down.
+And butterflies linger playfully -- an unbroken
+Dance floating to songs orioles sing at their ease.
+I don't so love blossoms I want to die. I'm afraid,
+Once they are gone, of old age still more impetuous.
+And they scatter gladly, by the branchful. Let's talk
+Things over, little buds ---open delicately, sparingly.

+Crafting my daytime drudgery into a compelling drama.
+Comedic, tragic and teasing, I know that you know what is real
+Yet in your eyes your enchantment is authentic and alluring
+Lovingly and knowingly you liberate my penchant for amusing anecdotes
+And in doing so my employ parallels the insipid and the inspiring
+Strange bedfellows and, as I recall, such was once upon a time said of us.
+Wine. Always a fine wine
+We grin at the devilish extravagance we could ill-afford
+Our working class veneer ajar to a shard of misplaced and, so you thought,
+Secret snobbery, though I name dropp wines as others name dropp exotic holidays
+For this is our weekly escape, our humble haven, nurtured with quirky formality,
+We know our roles. I put down my case and loosen my tie to invite your culinary
+Majesty through my veins as I place a kiss on your right cheek, the same cheek that you always offer. This is, I ponder, what you perceive to be your ‘Best Side’ and I smile as I see only two sides to your loveliness, your inside and your outside. I turn
+t’wards the stairs and say, as I always say, “Be with you in a minute my lovely”
+Silver. Always a breath on the silver.
+We laugh at my Aladdin moment as I polish the cutlery in the same timid and tender way I would dress our children’s playground grazes as if I too was feeling their pain. The table plan, my table plan, fastidious and engraved to memory, is arranged with orderly angles and sterile lines.  Did I ever ask you if it pleased you? Because, only now, can I concede the absence of any panache for the eye-catching that you could have so graciously and so effortlessly sprinkled upon the settings.   The likelihood is I never did ask and, as is my want, I will have assumed that such precision and attention to detail would have impressed you. And as I see you tonight, in this light, so ageless and timeless I feel an overwhelming urge to say sorry.
+Napkins. Always napkins.
+We marvel at our blessings ‘neath willowy dancing flame. Our memoirs modest,
+Our pleasures treasured and tonight, as ever, Friday ours.
+Our children flown and, with lives of their own, we turn to pictures. Leafing through albums I carefully and, unsurprisingly, catalogued, I wonder. Did you ever feel the urge to blithely launch our lifetime memories skyward and gaily sit amongst their random landings? But sweet flower that you are you suffer and indulge my symmetry.
+And now we are weary and I have talked too much so sleep safe my lovely for so shall I.

+A light exists in spring
+Not present on the year
+At any other period.
+When March is scarcely here
+A color stands abroad
+On solitary hills
+That science cannot overtake,
+But human naturefeels.
+It waits upon the lawn;
+It shows the furthest tree
+Upon the furthest slope we know;
+It almost speaks to me.
+Then, as horizons step,
+Or noons report away,
+Without the formula of sound,
+It passes, and we stay:
+A quality of loss
+Affecting our content,
+As trade had suddenly encroached
+Upon a sacrament.

+When I walked you home that night

+The sparks were flying left and right
+Jesus I was happy
+We talked and talked of this and that
+Nothing more than vapid chat
+I don’t remember what was said
+More than words were talking
+On and on we went like that
+Playing off and bouncing back
+So rare a thing to feel like that
+You made me happy
+Starry eyed and laughing
+As we said good night and parted
+And I floated helium hearted homeward
+God you made me happy
+That night when I went to bed
+I couldn’t sleep my buzzing head
+Was wondering what would happen next
+And guess what, I was happy
+That was now a month ago
+I’ve seen you come I’ve watched you go
+I’m wondering what the future holds
+And how to make you happy.
+I’d shower you with lies and gifts
+I’d move the earth if we could live
+Together you and me like this
+Great God I’m happy.

+If I were to stand in a pool of your tears
+And found that my acts placed them there
+Then love, my love… I would sink to hell.
+Where there is life I would not dwell.
+My heaven, sweet heaven, is in your smile,
+And heaven’s beauty I wish not defile;
+So, if my lips were to kiss one not your own,
+I pray my head would fall off its bone
+That it does not reach my heart of stone,
+Which will rot as this virus spreads.
+Instead of betraying your love, I rather be dead.
+And if my hands were to hold her waist as done to yours,
+My limps, every finger, I pray would be strewn
+Upon the ground, for it is better if I were a thought,
+Than to betray the one who gave me her heart.
+Your heart I value much more than rain
+On a desert journey of many years.
+Thirst be thirst… to mine for you, nothing compares.
+I long for you as a desert does for dew.
+Knowing that which I receive is not from me,
+I value your love; each day it gives jubilee.
+Your kiss is more than a kiss, it is a sign,
+And it says for eternity you will be mine.
+And as your shadow does, I belong to you,

+Where laughter filled the rims of each cup,
+Flowing over with desire and subdued embraces.
+Blue flowers floating on crimson waves
+Making its way into the enchanting waters.
+I reach for a petal,
+The beauty of it stands visible,
+Accepting rays of golden light from the sun,
+Extending her arms out to sprinkle kisses upon
+The silver sand below my feet.
+Wind from the east brushes me with thoughts of you,
+And the place where you once sat lit up from a falling star,

+And close my eyes to see the light on your face,
+Only knowing that deep inside me,
+You reside.

+Ask not the cause why sullen spring

+Chloris is gone; and Fate provides
+To make it spring where she resides.
+Chloris is gone, the cruel fair;
+She cast not back a pitying eye:
+But left her lover in despair,
+To sigh, to languish, and to die:
+Ah, how can those fair eyes endure
+To give the wounds they will not cure!

+And change the laws of ev'ry land?
+Where thou hadst plac'd such pow'r before,
+Thou shouldst have made her mercy more.

+And in loose Thetis blankets torn and tost.
+Frank, to undo thy self why art at cost?
+Nor be too confident, fix'd on the shore:
+For even that too borrows from the store
+Of her rich neighbour, since now wisest know
+(And this to Galileo's judgement ow),
+The palsie earth it self is every jot
+As frail, inconstant, waveing, as that blot
+We lay upon the deep, that sometimes lies
+Chang'd, you would think, with 's botoms properties;
+But this eternal, strange Ixion's wheel
+Of giddy earth ne'er whirling leaves to reel,
+Till all things are inverted, till they are
+Turn'd to that antick confus'd state they were.
+Who loves the golden mean, doth safely want
+A cobwebb'd cot and wrongs entail'd upon't;
+He richly needs a pallace for to breed
+Vipers and moths, that on their feeder feed;
+The toy that we (too true) a mistress call,
+Whose looking-glass and feather weighs up all;
+And cloaths which larks would play with in the sun,
+That mock him in the night, when 's course is run.
+To rear an edifice by art so high,
+That envy should not reach it with her eye,
+Nay, with a thought come neer it.  Wouldst thou know,
+How such a structure should be raisd, build low.
+The blust'ring winds invisible rough stroak
+More often shakes the stubborn'st, prop'rest oak;
+And in proud turrets we behold withal,
+'Tis the imperial top declines to fall:
+Nor does Heav'n's lightning strike the humble vales,
+But high-aspiring mounts batters and scales.
+A breast of proof defies all shocks of Fate,
+Fears in the best, hopes in worser state;
+Heaven forbid that, as of old, time ever
+Flourish'd in spring so contrary, now never.
+That mighty breath, which blew foul Winter hither,
+Can eas'ly puffe it to a fairer weather.

+Heard mountains moan in their sleep.By daylight,
+They remember nothing, and go about their lawful occasions

+They remember, however, that there is something they cannot remember.
+So moan.Theirs is the perfected pain of conscience that
+Of forgetting the crime, and I hope you have not suffered it.I have.
+I do not recall what had burdened my tongue, but urge you
+To think on the slug's white belly, how sick-slick and soft,
+On the hairiness of stars, silver, silver, while the silence
+Blows like wind by, and on the sea's virgin bosom unveiled
+To give suck to the wavering serpent of the moon; and,
+In the distance, in plaza, piazza, place, platz, and square,
+Boot heels, like history being born, on cobbles bang.
+Everything seems an echo of something else.
+And when, by the hair, the headsman held up the head
+Of Mary of Scots, the lips kept on moving,

+They were trying to say something very important.
+But I had forgotten to mention an upland
+Of wind-tortured stone white in darkness, and tall, but when
+No wind, mist gathers, and once on the Sarré at midnight,
+I watched the sheep huddling.Their eyes
+Stared into nothingness.In that mist-diffused light their eyes
+Were stupid and round like the eyes of fat fish in muddy water,
+Or of a scholar who has lost faith in his calling.
+Their jaws did not move.Shreds
+Of dry grass, gray in the gray mist-light, hung
+From the side of a jaw, unmoving.

+to lose you i know is one kind sorrow
+for i claim a loss that i never had even once owned.
+a play of words, and i know you do not understand
+what each word means, what a punctuation is.
+this heart that grieves for what it cannot even touch
+with its fragile hands, its trembling fingers
+for what i see is but a glimmer
+a faint light, a shadow, a hush, a slight glimpse
+no one knows what secret suffering is all about
+(secret so to say, i give it a language of its own)
+a heart that bleeds without drops of blood
+a heart injured yet without the bruises and wound
+i mix with the crowd just like what we do when we go malling.
+i smile like the way all people smile. i always have a glimpse of you.
+yet i know, i do not wait for anybody, or anything, this is simply
+an impossible endeavor. Clouds that dissipate. Air that vanish.
+a door that closes. a bus that leaves. a plane turning into a dot in space.
+i look up actually for nothing. i  pretend sometimes that there are stars where there are none but black clouds and tree tops.
+i look down and only see suffering. Pebbles and gray sands.
+i sleep without remembering my dreams. i wake up not thinking
+about what to do specifically with  my life. I have everything you say.
+but since i do not have you, i am still nothing. I am simply arms emptied
+of its embrace. I am hands groping with nothing but space.
+it does not matter. i touch my chest and feel that i am strong.
+i give up the gift of speech. I take in the gift of words written in utter silence.

+SAINT THYAGARAJA
+BRIEF INTRODUCTION
+The Saint Thyagaraja was born on the 4th May,1767
+at Tiruvarur, Tanjore District, South India. He came to
+lead the mankind in the spiritual path through the medium
+of Classical Music, purely devoted to Lord Rama.  He had
+composed classical songs in thousands during his life time,
+which are still very popular through out the world.
+During the period of Vijayanagar Empire in the Central India,
+which broke down due to frequent invasions from the North
+India, his ancestors took asylum in the Kingdom ruled by
+Maratha Nayak in South India. With this brief introduction
+his life story follows:
+SAINT THYAGARAJA
+(04-05-1767 to 06-01-1847)
+The year seventeen-sixty-seven,
+Witnessed the divine sanction
+From the Merciful Heaven
+For a great saint, who was born.
+It was on the fourth day,
+In the month of May,
+This saint took his birth
+On this mundane earth.
+The Temple Town Tiruvarur,
+Of the District Thanjavur,
+Became the chosen land,
+To welcome this child.
+True to their own custom
+He was given the name
+Thyagaraja, the Lord
+Of this Temple God.
+‘Thyaga, ’ a word for ‘sacrifice’
+‘Raja’ for ‘King or Prince, ’
+Thyagaraja, as his name stood,
+Lived in austerity till his end.
+He was the third son,
+The most illustrious one,
+Of Ramabrahmam, his father,
+And Seethamma, his mother.
+The King of Thanjavur
+Patronized his father,
+A story teller by profession,
+And an exponent of Ramayan.
+As a daughter of a Veena player,
+Kalahastayya, a royal court performer,
+Music was in Seethamma's blood
+And he grew up in this background.

+deprived us (as indeed it may..)   by dint
+of mindlessness, of something God's mind gives?
+I watch the spider, humble in my praise:
+self-spinning tightrope walker; engineer;
+the knower of all Nature's weathered ways
+and bold explorer on the winds that veer:
+Nature spares the spider Man's wild mind;
+should mind in Nature rest, there's more to find.

+“The whole world is watching
+How Sister Bernarde is living?
+Had she died, on us the blame
+Surely would’ve come.”
+“So, we should keep her
+Healthy and safe here,
+Let her duty be light
+Till she feels alright.”
+As a rebirth for her it was,
+The Bishop said like this.
+Taken out from the kitchen,
+Light work, she was given.
+She spent her time,
+In a spacious room,
+On works like paintings,
+And colorful drawings.
+She did them in perfection
+It was a center of attraction
+To every visiting personality
+Who praised her simplicity.
+One day a visitor came,
+Not announcing his name,
+With his long grey hair
+To meet and wish her.
+It took sometime for her,
+To recognize her father.
+She saw him very old
+He came there too tired.
+To see him, she was glad.
+She gave him nice food.
+About brothers and sister
+To hear, she was eager.
+He told, “We miss you
+But always remember you.
+By His grace, I’ve a mill
+That is running well.”
+“Your sister Marie has
+One boy and two girls
+And your two brothers
+Are my two helpers.”
+“To you, my dear child,
+So far, I haven’t been good
+Nor given you proper food
+From the days of childhood.”
+“No Papa, I never felt
+In my life like that.
+I was always happy.
+Now also, I’m happy.”
+“I’m sorry for mother
+Who loved me forever.
+Always I remember her.
+Now badly, I miss her.”

+A night of lust and love
+Brush your lips against my neck
+And so begins your siren trek
+I will obey your call and beck
+Am I your paladin?
+With my heart do I placate
+But with your eyes, you dominate
+Fairest maiden, single magnate
+Wield me with a passion
+Let thy heart be true and clear
+Let me love you without fear
+Let our souls entangle, dear
+Let this be the night
+Thus, the stars shine in the sky
+Thus, the moonstone rises high
+An audience to pain's demise
+Embrace your loyal knight
+Gently, graze the skin with lust
+You smile sweetly; vouch your trust
+I then advance; a gentle thrust
+A sigh of ecstasy
+Tongues engage, a lustful duel
+Yet, you win! Oh, how cruel...
+Arch for me, my precious jewel
+Be this destiny!
+Eyes hold fires, raging flames
+Lover's passion can't be tamed
+Sinful fires! I'm not ashamed
+Fury in our love!
+Harsher breathing as I drive
+Gods! I've never felt so alive
+Our souls, now, cannot be rived
+The stars envy above
+Harder, deeper, slower grinds
+A feeling that just blows my mind
+I hiss your name and say your mine
+The fire consumes us
+As we thrust and grind and kiss
+I call your name, everlasting mistress
+You call my name in utter bliss
+The climax of our lust!
+A flood of light! We both explode!
+We grasp each other and tightly hold!
+A cry of impulse thus untold!
+We collapse upon each other
+Now you gently kiss my lips,
+and gently, lovingly sway your hips.
+I'll taste your nectar in gentle sips
+We truly love one another
+Disclaimer: What happens in this poem never happened to me. I only hope it one day does. This was actually a dream I had and it made an impact on me enough that I'd like to share it.

+a frightful nausea gumming up the works
+that once was thought aggression in disguise.
+Do you remember? then how lightly dead
+seemed the moon when over factories
+it languid slid like a barrage of lead
+above the heart, the fierce inventories
+of desire. Now women wander our dreams
+carrying money and to our sleep's shame
+our hands twitch not for swift blood-sunk triremes
+nor languorous white horses nor ill fame,
+but clutch the groin that clouds a pallid sky
+where tow'rs are sinking in their common eye.
+2
+My ship is flung upon the gutter's wrist
+and cries for help of storm to violate
+that flesh your curiosity too late
+has flushed. The stem your garter tongue would twist
+has sunk upon the waveless bosom's mist,
+thigh of the city, apparition, hate,
+and the tower whose doves have, delicate,
+fled into my blood where they are not kissed.
+You have left me to the sewer's meanwhile,
+and I have answered the sea's open wish
+to love me as a bonfire's watchful hand
+guards red the shore and guards the hairy strand,
+our most elegant lascivious bile,
+my ship sinking beneath the gutter's fish.
+3
+How can I then, my dearest winter lay,
+disgorge the tasty worm that eats me up
+falling onto the stem of a highway
+whose ardent rainbow is the spoon's flat cup
+and in the vilest of blue suited force
+enamored of the heated needle's arm
+finds the ministrant an own tongue's remorse
+so near the blood and still so far from harm,
+thus to be eaten up and gobbled down
+volcanoes of speedometers, the strike
+that heats the iris into flame and flow'rs
+the panting chalice so a turning pike:
+you are not how the gods refused to die,
+and I am scarred forever neath the eye.
+4
+What are my eyes? if they must feed me, rank
+with forgetting, in the jealous forest
+of lustrous blows, so luminously blank
+through smoke and in the light. All faint, at rest,
+yet I am racing towards the fear that kills
+them off, friends and lovers, hast'ning through tears
+like alcohol high in the throat of hills
+and hills of night, alluring! their black cheers
+falling upon my ears like nails. And there
+the bars grow thick with onanists and camps
+and bivouacs of bears with clubs, are fair
+with their blows, deal death beneath purple lamps
+and to me! I run! closer always move,
+crying my name in fields of dead I love.
+5
+I plunge deep within this frozen lake
+whose mirrored fastnesses fill up my heart,
+where tears drift from frivolity to art
+all white and slobbering, and by mistake
+are the sky. I'm no whale to cruise apart
+in fields impassive of my stench, my sake,
+my sign to crushing seas that fall like fake
+pillars to crash! to sow as wake my heart
+and don't be niggardly. The snow drifts low
+and yet neglects to cover me, and I
+dance just ahead to keep my heart in sight.
+How like a queen, to seek with jealous eye
+the face that flees you, hidden city, white
+swan. There's no art to free me, blinded so.

+We were challenged by The Dingoes - they're the pride of Squatter's Gap-
+To a friendly game of football on the flat by Devil's Trap.
+And we went along on horses, sworn to triumph in the game,
+For the honour of Gyp's Diggings, and the glory of the same.
+And we took the challenge with us. It was beautiful to see,
+With its lovely curly letters, at its pretty filigree.
+It was very gently worded, and it made us all feel good,
+For it breathed the sweetest sentiments of peace and brotherhood.
+We had Chang, and Trucker Hogan, and the man who licked The Plug,
+Also Heggarty, and Hoolahan, and Peter Scott, the pug;
+And we wore our knuckle-dusters, and we took a keg on tap
+To our friendly game of football with The Dingoes at The Gap.
+All the fellows came to meet us, and we spoke like brothers dear.
+They'd a tip-dray full of tucker, and a waggon load of beer,
+And some lint done up in bundles; so we reckoned there'd be fun
+Ere our friendly game of football with the Dingo Club was done.
+Their umpire was a homely man, a stranger to the push,
+With a sweet, deceitful calmness, and a flavour of the bush.
+He declared he didn't know the game, but promised on his oath
+To see fair and square between the teams, or paralyse them both.
+Then we bounced the ball and started, and for twenty minutes quite
+We observed a proper courtesy and a heavenly sense of right,
+But Fitzpatrick tipped McDougal in a handy patch of mud,
+And the hero rose up, chewing dirt, and famishing for blood.
+Simple Simonsen, the umpire, sorted out the happy pair,
+And he found a pitch to suit them, and we left them fighting there;
+But The Conqueror and Cop-Out met with cries of rage and pain,
+And wild horses couldn't part those ancient enemies again.
+So the umpire dragged them from the ruck, and pegged them off a patch,
+And then gave his best attention to the slugging and the match.
+You could hardly wish to come across a fairer-minded chap
+For a friendly game of football than that umpire at The Gap.
+In a while young Smith, and Henty, and Blue Ben, and Dick, and Blake,
+Chose their partners from The Dingoes, and went pounding for the cake.
+Timmy Hogan hit the umpire, and was promptly put to bed
+'Neath the ammunition waggon, with a bolus on his head.
+Feeling lonely-like, Magee took on a local star named Bent,
+And four others started fighting to avoid an argument:
+So Simonsen postponed the game, for fear some slight mishap
+Might disturb the pleasant feeling then prevailing at The Gap.
+Sixty seconds later twenty lively couples held the floor,
+And the air was full of whiskers, and the grass was tinged with gore,
+And the umpire kept good order in the interests of peace,
+Whilst the people, to oblige him, sat severely on the p'lice.
+Well, we fought the friendly game out, but I couldn't say who won;
+We were all stretched out on shutters when the glorious day was done;
+Both the constables had vanished; one was carried off to bunk,
+And the umpire was exhausted, and the populace was drunk.
+But we've written out a paper, with good Father Feeley's aid,
+Breathing brotherly affection; and the challenge is conveyed
+To the Dingo Club at Squatter's, and another friendly game
+Will eventuate at this end, on the flat below the claim.
+We have pressed The Gap to bring their central umpire if they can-
+Here we honestly admire him as a fair and decent man-
+And we're building on a pleasant time beside the Phoenix slums,
+For The Giant feels he's got a call to plug him if he comes.

+Uses no grizzled cords upon his bow.
+How will it be when I, no longer fair,
+Plead for his kiss with cheeks, whence long ago
+The early snowflakes melted quite away,
+The rose leaf died – and in whose sallow clay
+Lie the deep sunken tracks of life’s gaunt crow?
+When this full throat shall wattle fold on fold,
+Like some ripe peach left drying on a wall,
+Or like a spent accordion, when all
+Its music has exhaled – will love grow cold?

+A little soul scarce fledged for earth
+Takes wing with heaven again for goal
+Even while we hailed as fresh from birth
+A little soul.
+Our thoughts ring sad as bells that toll,
+Not knowing beyond this blind world's girth
+What things are writ in heaven's full scroll.
+Our fruitfulness is there but dearth,
+And all things held in time's control
+Seem there, perchance, ill dreams, not worth
+A little soul.
+The little feet that never trod
+Earth, never strayed in field or street,
+What hand leads upward back to God
+The little feet?
+A rose in June's most honied heat,
+When life makes keen the kindling sod,
+Was not so soft and warm and sweet.
+Their pilgrimage's period
+A few swift moons have seen complete
+Since mother's hands first clasped and shod
+The little feet.
+The little hands that never sought
+Earth's prizes, worthless all as sands,
+What gift has death, God's servant, brought
+The little hands?
+We ask:  but love's self silent stands,
+Love, that lends eyes and wings to thought
+To search where death's dim heaven expands.
+Ere this, perchance, though love know nought,
+Flowers fill them, grown in lovelier lands,
+Where hands of guiding angels caught
+The little hands.
+The little eyes that never knew
+Light other than of dawning skies,
+What new life now lights up anew
+The little eyes?
+Who knows but on their sleep may rise
+Such light as never heaven let through
+To lighten earth from Paradise?
+No storm, we know, may change the blue
+Soft heaven that haply death descries
+No tears, like these in ours, bedew
+The little eyes.
+Was life so strange, so sad the sky,
+So strait the wide world's range,
+He would not stay to wonder why
+Was life so strange?
+Was earth's fair house a joyless grange
+Beside that house on high
+Whence Time that bore him failed to estrange?
+That here at once his soul put by
+All gifts of time and change,
+And left us heavier hearts to sigh
+'Was life so strange?'
+Angel by name love called him, seeing so fair
+The sweet small frame;
+Meet to be called, if ever man's child were,
+Angel by name.
+Rose-bright and warm from heaven's own heart he came,
+And might not bear
+The cloud that covers earth's wan face with shame.
+His little light of life was all too rare
+And soft a flame:
+Heaven yearned for him till angels hailed him there
+Angel by name.
+The song that smiled upon his birthday here
+Weeps on the grave that holds him undefiled
+Whose loss makes bitterer than a soundless tear
+The song that smiled.
+His name crowned once the mightiest ever styled
+Sovereign of arts, and angel:  fate and fear
+Knew then their master, and were reconciled.
+But we saw born beneath some tenderer sphere
+Michael, an angel and a little child,
+Whose loss bows down to weep upon his bier
+The song that smiled.

+I'll tell you a crime story that you've never heard,
+But first you'll have to promise to not spread the word.
+It started many years ago on the Massachusetts coast.
+Most of those who know of it are now themselves ghosts.
+It is a murder story frightful and most ghastly.
+If you mention it to the police they'll laugh, and YOU may be the victim, lastly.
+After high school in the 60's I attended Boston College.
+I went there for the social life, and to gain some more knowledge.
+While there I joined a fraternity made up mostly of jocks.
+Initiation week they made us attend classes with no shoes or sox.
+I'm getting off the track a bit as does happen often.
+I think too many drugs in the 60's caused my brain to soften.
+A member of my fraternity was a B.C. basketball star;
+He was scouted by the pros and it was felt he'd go far.
+He was 6 foot 7 and his meals were supersized.
+He was my closest friend and I enjoyed looking up at his eyes.
+One night in the off season he went drinking at a bar.
+He left the joint at 2 A.M. but he didn't get far.
+He was found by a sanitation worker early the next morn.
+His skull had been bashed in; his massive throat was well-torn.
+It was a campus and Boston sensation, a sad one it was true.
+I was crushed by his passing and from college I withdrew.
+I had lots of money from my grandma; I did not need a job.
+I moved to Miami and became a beach bum, not a slob.
+Within three years two more murders were added to this story.
+The descriptions of the bodies found were EXTREMELY gory.
+One, a 6-4 white male prostitute, had been eviscerated.
+The police photos of a black female socialite,6-3, were XXX-rated.
+My parents lived in Santa Monica and insisted I move home.
+I settled in their guest house but at times I still did roam.
+I met and dated a wealthy,6-5, fashion model………
+The largest piece of her flesh found would fit inside a large bottle.
+I started, then to see a shrink; I worried I'd go crazy.
+I'm telling you my story's true, though at times details are hazy.
+I spent ten years in analysis, which cost a lot of money,
+But I believe it helped restore my faith and my outlook was more-sunny.
+Then one summer I did Rio Mardi Gras; it was my BEST vacation yet.
+But back home I learned my doctor had been found in his red Corvette.
+What was left of him, I should say.  I hesitate to here linger.
+He'd been shot twelve times and was missing his left ring finger.
+His skull and most of his ribs had been busted.
+The once-shiny car had been burned, and his body was all-crusted.
+By the way my doctor was 6 foot 4; could that be a clue?
+I then checked into an upscale nuthouse for a month or two.
+I was there on my own accord.  My parents thought I was 'shopping'.
+The docs did not believe my stories; my anxiety was not stopping.
+So I moved back to the guest house. 'Mom and Dad, did you miss me? '
+Fat chance!  They were busy with their lives, though once my mom did kiss me.
+I found another psychiatrist, this one of short stature.
+I met a pretty clerk at Starbucks and at the altar I did catch her.
+The marriage lasted all of six months.  No pregnancy, thank God.
+I had it annulled, gave her twenty grand, but I still miss her bod.
+My weekly doctor's visits went as well as I'd expected.
+I tried a run for Santa Monica mayor but did not get elected.
+Two more murders in my story just happened this year.
+They were the murders of my parents for which I shed no tear.
+It was an inconvenience, though, cleaning up the mess.
+The police photographer threw up; ……hardened detectives cried no less.
+I had to hire TWO murder cleanup crews.  Their bills were a sin.
+But  still, afterward, I found pieces in the bushes, which made me grin.
+There were other bodies I now realize I've forgotten to mention.
+I can see from the look in your eyes I've gotten your attention.
+All the victims were at least 6-3 (my mom WAS 6 foot 4, my dad was 6-7) .
+Maybe all are gazing down now at us from a tall-people's heaven.
+My doctor says I'm the murderer; she told me for a fee.
+I'm really glad I met you; you're pretty as can be.
+I'll bet you're as tall as me; I am 6 foot 3 inches tall.
+It's getting dark and I love you.  Let's drive to the mall.

+Nicolas Shrady; sceptic on a pilgrimage,
+following holy trails to religious shrines,
+seeking the spiritual within the physical –
+realising he was ‘an outsider, a passive
+observer, and always would be’
+Saw artificial attempts to impress, had to
+be content with only meditation, could not
+simulate false piety, couldn’t find what he
+doesn’t already believe
+Observation proved fickle – symbolical
+content depends on already present belief,
+tried ceremonies, followed customs, found
+faith had no roots in anything substantial
+Supernatural events happen to believers
+only, which the five senses abjure, faithless
+see nothing; he enjoyed a fabulous spiritual
+journey, made  friends,
+Learned to appreciate wonder and beauty of
+innocence, trust in the human heart, but  the
+ability of the believer to make things true
+which a sceptic can never see taught him
+honour and respect…

+Imagine yourself -
+yourself, to imagine –
+this dream; dream
+this imaging:
+the water’s so far, far below
+it’s beyond this dark imagining, this dream;
+all your attention is required
+by this rope bridge,
+swayed by nature to some immediate, vibrating laws
+of this way, that way, more complex
+than steel or concrete bear in mind –
+five lines of rope, that’s all,
+bound from time to time
+but only every few and fearful steps
+so that they do not part
+unless you tread without remembering
+all five of them; toe, heel, as you place your foot…
+and now it seems, in the illogical
+precision of this dream – which is in
+league with some dark inner truth
+and so, it must be walked – now,
+it’s not five ropes, any more,
+but five strings of some instrument
+vibrating, low and high; while tense, taut mind
+looks for firm frets to tune each step;
+or can you trust their tuning?
+is the tuning now the fingers of your feet?
+each fallible or faulty foothold
+will send its string’s own warning of uncertainty:
+this bass string, booming failure between the valley’s two high cliffs;
+this treble string, nerve-searing scream of pain;
+ahead, this firm support that holds the strings, now
+drops away; the hollow soundbox that’s all space,
+all sound, all air, all touch and light and flow of sound;
+the sound of judgment’s stern and justly-tempered final chord –
+now you awake: relieved, yet with a question,
+born of night, to be resolved by day;
+what does the dream tell to the waking thought?
+what does the waking thought tell of the dream?
+some metaphor for life inhabited your dream;
+some knowledge passed, wrapped in a metaphor;
+you only know, that it was watched – by whom?

+The twitter, sometimes, of a wayward bird

+Father, first of all know how much I love you and appreciate you
+in my life.  Father you never leave me, always there to see me
+through.  This week Father you were ever present in not only my
+life but that of my daughter and I thank you for what you did for
+her this week.  She now understands what I’ve been telling her
+for quite sometime.  There you were Father showing her what she
+needed to see, giving her the inspiration she needed and filling
+her with positive energy enabling her to go after her dream with
+the gifts that you gave her so long ago.  Thank you Father God for
+always being present in my life.
+Father I ask you to touch the  life  of a sister poet and her husband.
+I know you know who I’m speaking of Father, so I won’t mention
+any names.  I speak of a sister poet who lives a difficult life dealing with an alcoholic husband, but you know Father she is
+standing by her husband, taking one day at a time.
+Today Father I pray for a healing for this man,  help him to give  up this addiction in his life, help him to see the light, to  realize
+what is happening to his wife, to know that he is going down hill
+and needs to fight his way back into the real world.  This man
+Father God is living as you know, in a haze, so I pray for a healing.
+I pray that you step into their lives and show them your power.
+I know there isn’t anything that you can’t do, you’ve showed me
+that over and over Lord, now I ask that you do the same thing for
+this couple.  She is tired Lord, tired of looking at her husband,
+asking herself-why-. I’m sure this man wants to give up this
+habit, but  he doesn’t know how Lord, but Father  with your help, he can do it.  Father God he needs a helping hand.  He has the
+support of his wife and with your divine power and the blood of
+Jesus covering them, they will find the strength to move on and
+leave this alcoholic addiction behind them.
+Father I ask that you talk to him, show him the way, inspire him to
+want Jesus to be the center of their lives and to have a wonderful
+relationship with you Father God.  Only you can help these people Father, only you can tear away the dark covering and shed  a bright
+light within their lives. Father God, I pray for all others that may be suffering from this addiction, I pray that you enter their lives and give them a healing as well.  I know you know best Father and
+I leave this with you for you are the all powerful, the all knowing
+and the master of the universe.
+Thank you Father for everything you do, I thank you  in the name of your son Jesus-Amen

+Congratulate Kelly, on your graduation.
+After four years of studies, you graduated from Dental school!
+Now you have your license to practice
+But you prefer more training in your sub-specialty.
+You'll spend two more years in school
+And you'll accumulate more astronomical debts!
+This week, you made a trip to Philadelphia.
+You visited new school with your mother and brother.
+Next two years you will be a resident at Penn Dental school
+To receive special training in orthodontics.
+You'll pay expensive rent these years.
+Fortunately, your classmate shares one half of the rent.
+So now, you can put your mind to study hard.
+Two years from now, you'll graduate from this ivy school to enter your practice.
+Thank you for visiting me and your aunt.
+As a small gift to you, this poem is our congratulations.

+'Twas at the royal feast for Persia won
+By Philip's warlike son—
+Aloft in awful state
+The godlike hero sate
+On his imperial throne;
+His valiant peers were placed around,
+Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound
+(So should desert in arms be crowned);
+The lovely Thais by his side
+Sate like a blooming eastern bride
+In flower of youth and beauty's pride:—
+Happy, happy, happy pair!
+None but the brave
+None but the brave
+None but the brave deserves the fair!
+Timotheus placed on high
+Amid the tuneful quire
+With flying fingers touched the lyre;
+The trembling notes ascend the sky
+And heavenly joys inspire.
+The song began from Jove
+Who left his blissful seats above—
+Such is the power of mighty love!
+A dragon's fiery form belied the god
+Sublime on radiant spires he rode
+When he to fair Olympia prest,
+And while he sought her snowy breast,
+Then round her slender waist he curled,
+And stamped an image of himself, a sovereign of the world.
+- The listening crowd admire the lofty sound!
+A present deity! they shout around:
+A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound!
+With ravished ears
+The monarch hears,
+Assumes the god,
+Affects to nod,
+And seems to shake the spheres.
+The praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung,
+Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young:
+The jolly god in triumph comes!
+Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!
+Flushed with a purple grace
+He shows his honest face:
+Now give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes!
+Bacchus, ever fair and young,
+Drinking joys did first ordain;
+Bacchus' blessings are a treasure,
+Drinking is the soldier's pleasure:
+Rich the treasure,
+Sweet the pleasure,
+Sweet is pleasure after pain.
+Soothed with the sound, the king grew vain;
+Fought all his battles o'er again,
+And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain.
+The master saw the madness rise,
+His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes;
+And while he Heaven and Earth defied
+Changed his hand and checked his pride.
+He chose a mournful Muse
+Soft pity to infuse:
+He sung Darius great and good,
+By too severe a fate
+Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,
+Fallen from his high estate,
+And weltering in his blood;
+Deserted, at his utmost need,
+By those his former bounty fed;
+On the bare earth exposed he lies
+With not a friend to close his eyes.
+- With downcast looks the joyless victor sate,
+Revolving in his altered soul
+The various turns of Chance below;
+And now and then a sigh he stole,
+And tears began to flow.
+The mighty master smiled to see
+That love was in the next degree;
+'Twas but a kindred-sound to move,
+For pity melts the mind to love.
+Softly sweet, in Lydian measures
+Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures.
+War, he sung, is toil and trouble,
+Honour but an empty bubble;
+Never ending, still beginning,
+Fighting still, and still destroying;
+If the world be worth thy winning,
+Think, O think, it worth enjoying:
+Lovely Thais sits beside thee,
+Take the good the gods provide thee!
+- The many rend the skies with loud applause;
+So Love was crowned, but Music won the cause.
+The prince, unable to conceal his pain,
+Gazed on the fair
+Who caused his care,
+And sighed and looked, sighed and looked,
+Sighed and looked, and sighed again:
+At length with love and wine at once opprest
+The vanquished victor sunk upon her breast.
+Now strike the golden lyre again:
+A louder yet, and yet a louder strain!
+Break his bands of sleep asunder
+And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder.
+Hark, hark! the horrid sound
+Has raised up his head:
+As awaked from the dead
+And amazed he stares around.
+Revenge, revenge, Timotheus cries,
+See the Furies arisel
+See the snakes that they rear
+How they hiss in their hair,
+And the sparkles that flash from their eyes!
+Behold a ghastly band,
+Each a torch in his hand!
+Those are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain
+And unburied remain
+Inglorious on the plain:
+Give the vengeance due
+To the valiant crew!
+Behold how they toss their torches on high,
+How they point to the Persian abodes
+And glittering temples of their hostile gods.
+- The princes applaud with a furious joy:
+And the King seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy;
+Thais led the way
+To light him to his prey,
+And like another Helen, fired another Troy!
+- Thus, long ago,
+Ere heaving bellows learned to blow,
+While organs yet were mute,
+Timotheus, to his breathing flute
+And sounding lyre,
+Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire.
+At last divine Cecilia came,
+Inventress of the vocal frame;
+The sweet enthusiast from her sacred store
+Enlarged the former narrow bounds,
+And added length to solemn sounds,
+With Nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before.
+- Let old Timotheus yield the prize
+Or both divide the crown;
+He raised a mortal to the skies;
+She drew an angel down!

+Take your bells and chime away,

+Now raise your hands if you know the reason,

+One, two, three, four, oh my, more and more.

+Now, let’s think a moment of our sweet Jesus.
+Why we know he’ll never leave us.
+He gave his life upon the cross,

+Today we celebrate his precious birth,

+Clap your hands rejoice for all to see.

+A Recipe for Suicide
+Take lies and fears
+And a pinch of regret and also
+A little confusion and mistakes.
+Put sickness and worry
+And a cup full of betrayal
+In an enormous cauldron of tears.
+Mix with depression
+And a touch of failure
+Until tears rush down your face.
+Throw in a miscarriage
+And a lost love or two.
+Then, broil in a broken heart
+At one million degrees
+Until overwhelmed with grief and sorrow.
+You can tell it’s done
+When you can stand no more pain.
+Let stand until tired of the madness of the world.
+Sprinkle on some jealousy
+And serve with sadness and unrest.
+Taste a touch of suicide.

+write them not."                           --REVELATIONS, x, 4.
+That raft we rigged up, under the water,
+Was just the item: when he walked,
+With his robes blowing, dark against the sky,
+It was as though the unsubstantial waves held up
+His slender and inviolate feet. The gulls flew over,
+Dropping, crying alone; thin ragged lengths of cloud
+Drifted in bars across the sun. There on the shore
+The crowd's response was instantaneous. He
+Handled it well, I thought--the gait, the tilt of the head, just right.
+Long streaks of light were blinding on the waves.
+And then we knew our work well worth the time:
+The days of sawing, fitting, all those nails,
+The tiresome rehearsals, considerations of execution.
+But if you want a miracle, you have to work for it,
+Lay your plans carefully and keep one jump
+Ahead of the crowd. To report a miracle
+Is a pleasure unalloyed; but staging one requires
+Tact, imagination, a special knack for the job
+Not everyone possesses. A miracle, in fact, means work.
+--And now there are those who have come saying
+That miracles were not what we were after. But what else
+Is there? What other hope does life hold out
+But the miraculous, the skilled and patient
+Execution, the teamwork, all the pain and worry every miracle involves?
+Visionaries tossing in their beds, haunted and racked
+By questions of Messiahship and eschatology,
+Are like the mist rising at nightfall, and come,
+Perhaps to even less. Grave supernaturalists, devoted worshippers
+Experience the ecstasy (such as it is), but not
+Our ecstasy. It was our making. Yet sometimes
+When the torrent of that time
+Comes pouring back, I wonder at our courage
+And our enterprise. It was as though the world
+Had been one darkening, abandoned hall
+Where rows of unlit candles stood; and we
+Not out of love, so much, or hope, or even worship, but
+Out of the fear of death, came with our lights
+And watched the candles, one by one, take fire, flames
+Against the long night of our fear. We thought
+That we could never die. Now I am less convinced.
+--The traveller on the plain makes out the mountains
+At a distance; then he loses sight. His way
+Winds through the valleys; then, at a sudden turning of a path,
+The peaks stand nakedly before him: they are something else
+Than what he saw below. I think now of the raft
+(For me, somehow, the summit of the whole experience)
+And all the expectations of that day, but also of the cave
+We stocked with bread, the secret meetings
+In the hills, the fake assassins hired for the last pursuit,
+The careful staging of the cures, the bribed officials,
+The angels' garments, tailored faultlessly,
+The medicines administered behind the stone,
+That ultimate cloud, so perfect, and so opportune.
+Who managed all that blood I never knew.
+The days get longer. It was a long time ago.
+And I have come to that point in the turning of the path
+Where peaks are infinite--horn-shaped and scaly, choked with
+thorns.
+But even here, I know our work was worth the cost.
+What we have brought to pass, no one can take away.
+Life offers up no miracles, unfortunately, and needs assistance.
+Nothing will be the same as once it was,
+I tell myself.--It's dark here on the peak, and keeps on getting
+darker.
+It seems I am experiencing a kind of ecstasy.
+Was it sunlight on the waves that day? The night comes down.
+And now the water seems remote, unreal, and perhaps it is.

+For Ann London
+As you described your mastectomy in calm detail
+and bared your chest so I might see
+the puckered scar,
+"They took a hatchet to your breast!" I said. "What an
+Amazon you are."
+When we were girls we climbed Mt. Tamalpais
+chewing bay leaves we had plucked
+along the way;
+we got high all right, from animal pleasure in each other,
+shouting to the sky.
+On your houseboat we tried to ignore the impossible guy
+you had married to enrage your family,
+a typical ploy.
+We were great fools let loose in the No Name bar
+on Sausalito's bay.
+In San Francisco we'd perch on a waterfront pier
+chewing sourdough and cheese, swilling champagne,
+kicking our heels;
+crooning lewd songs, hooting like seagulls,
+we bayed with the seals.
+Then you married someone in Mexico,
+broke up in two weeks, didn't bother to divorce,
+claimed it didn't count.
+You dumped number three, fled to Albany
+to become a pedant.
+Averse to domesticity, you read for your Ph.D.
+Your four-year-old looked like a miniature
+John Lennon.
+You fed him peanut butter from your jar and raised him
+on Beowulf and Grendal.
+Much later in New York we reunited;
+in an elevator at Sak's a woman asked for
+your autograph.
+You glowed like a star, like Anouk Aimee
+at forty, close enough.
+Your pedantry found its place in the Women's Movement.
+You rose fast, seen suddenly as the morning star;
+wrote the ERA
+found the right man at last, a sensitive artist;
+flying too high
+not to crash. When the cancer caught you
+you went on talk shows to say you had no fear
+or faith.
+In Baltimore we joked on your bed as you turned into
+a witty wraith.
+When you died I cleaned out your bureau drawers:
+your usual disorder; an assortment of gorgeous wigs
+and prosthetic breasts
+tossed in garbage bags, to spare your gentle spouse.
+Then the bequests
+you had made to every friend you had!
+For each of us a necklace or a ring.
+A snapshot for me:
+We two, barefoot in chiffon, laughing amid blossoms
+your last wedding day.

+And sweetheart captures of the waist,
+How swiftly still the virgin runs
+She's sure at last to be embraced!
+Now Colin fires at kiss delayed,
+And faster flits the red stone floor
+Till Fortune yields the tricky maid
+A captive at the pantry door!
+The farmer with his fifty years
+Is not too old to join the fun;
+He pulls the milkmaids' pinky ears
+And bids a likely stripling run
+To find the fiddlers for a dance:
+And in the cherry orchard there
+A tune shall mingle with romance,
+And love be brave in open air.
+The village wakens to the bliss,
+The crones and gaffers crawl to see
+The country game of step and kiss
+Beneath the laden cherry-tree.
+The chairs and benches now are set,
+Old John is wheedled from his pet,
+The cider cup with beady eyes
+Responds to winkings of the skies.
+The farmer, burly in his chair,
+Now claps for ev'ry fond and fair
+To foot it on the grassy patch
+While rustic violinists snatch
+From out those varnished birds of wood
+A tune to jink it in the blood.
+Now Jane and Colin in a trice
+Float sweetly round not less than thrice
+Before their motion draws a pair
+To revel with the dancing air.
+The thrush, that on his velvet wipes
+His juicy bill, protesting pipes,
+And, somewhat as a piccolo,
+Doth race the concord of the bow.
+A virgin yonder by the tree
+Rejects a mate who saucily
+Would press, if she might only start,
+Her modest homespun to his heart.
+Ah, sweet-lip ways and sweet-lip days,
+And sweetheart captures of the waist,
+Though like a finch the maiden flies
+She's sure at last to be embraced.
+The orchard now is in full bloom
+With rosy cheek and snowdrop throat;
+The stars invade the growing gloom,
+And rarelier sounds the blackbird's note.
+But in this dewy little park
+Love burns the brighter for the dark,
+And till he use a stricter rule
+Dear Cicely's cheek shall never cool!
+The fiddlers storm a tomboy tune,
+The shepherds closer clasp the girls
+While skirts the more desert the shoon,
+And rebel leap the loely curls.
+The farmer glows within his chair
+And muses on the dancing time
+When he and she--a matchless pair--
+Were warm and nimble in their prime.
+God bless the man who, duller grown,
+Can feel the younger heaven anew
+By granting to his maids and men
+A romp by starlight in the dew!
+Ah, greenwood ways and greenwood days,
+And soft pursuings of the waist,
+The cheek must yellow out of praise,
+And bent be those who once embraced!
+And now they pant against the trees,
+And, using darkness for their plan,
+Girls loose the garters at their knees
+And mend the clumsiness of man.
+One virgin, thankful for the dance,
+About the music shyly trips--
+Her Love's a fiddler, and her love
+Pops fruit in Paganini's lips;
+Or finding on the starlit tree
+The wife and husband cherry there,
+She hangs the couple at his cheek
+And hides the stalk with tufts of hair.
+The girls are at the cider-cup,
+And shepherds tilt the yellow base
+Until a giddy amber flood
+Runs, kissing, over Cicely's face,
+And Dora's upper lip doth shine
+With winking beads of apple-wine.
+The fiddlers scrape a farewell tune,
+The dancers dwindle in the dusk
+While summer puffs of easy wind
+Bring hints of cottage garden musk.
+And thus the revel dearly ends
+With milkmaid's palm in shepherd's hand,
+And lovers grow from only friends
+Where plum and pear and apple stand.
+Ah, sweet-lip ways and sweet-lip days,
+And sweetheart captures of the waist,
+How fast so-e'er the virgin flies
+She's sure at last to be embraced!

+I can see a soldier's mother

+She is remembering the heartfelt joy

+She gloried in his every little achievement
+For he was her flesh and blood.
+It was only temporary bereavement
+When he would come in covered with mud.
+Sometimes he rode a stick horse
+All over a vast front yard range.
+He was rounding up cattle of course
+Every detail he took care to arrange.
+Somtimes he rode till it was night
+Searching this range for his cattle.
+He was never far from his mother's sight

+The deck of an ancient ship.  At the right of the stage is the mast, with a large square sail hiding a great deal of the sky and sea on that side.  The tiller is at the left of the stage; it is a long oar coming through an opening in the bulwark.  The deck rises in a series of steps hehind the tiller, and the stern of the ship curves overhead.  When the play opens there are four persons upon the deck.  Aibric stands by the tiller.  Forgael sleeps upon the raised portion of the deck towards the front of the stage.  Two Sailors are standing near to the mast, on which a harp is hanging.
+First Sailor. Has he not led us into these waste seas
+For long enough?
+Second Sailor. Aye, long and long enough.
+First Sailor. We have not come upon a shore or ship
+These dozen weeks.
+Sccond Sailor. And I had thought to make
+A good round Sum upon this cruise, and turn --
+For I am getting on in life -- to something
+That has less ups and downs than robbery.
+First Sailor. I am so tired of being bachelor
+I could give all my heart to that Red Moll
+That had but the one eye.
+Second Sailor. Can no bewitchment
+Transform these rascal billows into women
+That I may drown myself?
+First Sailor. Better steer home,
+Whether he will or no; and better still
+To take him while he sleeps and carry him
+And drop him from the gunnel.
+Second Sailor. I dare not do it.
+Were't not that there is magic in his harp,
+I would be of your mind; but when he plays it
+Strange creatures flutter up before one's eyes,
+Or cry about one's ears.
+First Sailor. Nothing to fear.
+Second Sailor. Do you remember when we sank that
+galley
+At the full moon?
+First Sailor. He played all through the night.
+Second Sailor. Until the moon had set; and when I looked
+Where the dead drifted, I could see a bird
+Like a grey gull upon the breast of each.
+While I was looking they rose hurriedly,
+And after circling with strange cries awhile
+Flew westward; and many a time since then
+I've heard a rustling overhead in the wind.
+First Sailor. I saw them on that night as well as you.
+But when I had eaten and drunk myself asleep
+My courage came again.
+Second Sailor. But that's not all.
+The other night, while he was playing it,
+A beautiful young man and girl came up
+In a white breaking wave; they had the look
+Of those that are alive for ever and ever.
+First Sailor. I saw them, too, one night.  Forgael was
+playing,
+And they were listening ther& beyond the sail.
+He could not see them, but I held out my hands
+To grasp the woman.
+Second Sailor. You have dared to touch her?
+First Sailor. O she was but a shadow, and slipped from
+me.
+Second Sailor. But were you not afraid?
+First Sailor. Why should I fear?
+Second Sailor. 'Twas Aengus and Edain, the wandering
+lovers,
+To whom all lovers pray.
+First Sailor. But what of that?
+A shadow does not carry sword or spear.
+Second Sailor. My mother told me that there is not one
+Of the Ever-living half so dangerous
+As that wild Aengus.  Long before her day
+He carried Edain off from a king's house,
+And hid her among fruits of jewel-stone
+And in a tower of glass, and from that day
+Has hated every man that's not in love,
+And has been dangerous to him.
+First Sailor. I have heard
+He does not hate seafarers as he hates
+Peaceable men that shut the wind away,
+And keep to the one weary marriage-bed.
+Second Sailor. I think that he has Forgael in his net,
+And drags him through the sea,
+First Sailor Well, net or none,
+I'd drown him while we have the chance to do it.
+Second Sailor. It's certain I'd sleep easier o' nights
+If he were dead; but who will be our captain,
+Judge of the stars, and find a course for us?
+First Sailor. I've thought of that.  We must have Aibric
+with us,
+For he can judge the stars as well as Forgael.
+[Going towards Aibric.]
+Become our captain, Aibric.  I am resolved
+To make an end of Forgael while he sleeps.
+There's not a man but will be glad of it
+When it is over, nor one to grumble at us.
+Aibric. You have taken pay and made your bargain for it.
+First Sailor. What good is there in this hard way of
+living,
+Unless we drain more flagons in a year
+And kiss more lips than lasting peaceable men
+In their long lives? Will you be of our troop
+And take the captain's share of everything
+And bring us into populous seas again?
+Aibric. Be of your troop! Aibric be one of you
+And Forgael in the other scale! kill Forgael,
+And he my master from my childhood up!
+If you will draw that sword out of its scabbard
+I'll give my answer.
+First Sailor. You have awakened him.
+[To Second Sailor.]
+We'd better go, for we have lost this chance.
+[They go out.]
+Forgael. Have the birds passed us? I could hear your
+voice,
+But there were others.
+Aibric. I have seen nothing pass.
+Forgael. You're certain of it? I never wake from sleep
+But that I am afraid they may have passed,
+For they're my only pilots.  If I lost them
+Straying too far into the north or south,
+I'd never come upon the happiness
+That has been promised me.  I have not seen them
+These many days; and yet there must be many
+Dying at every moment in the world,
+And flying towards their peace.
+Aibric. Put by these thoughts,
+And listen to me for a while.  The sailors
+Are plotting for your death.
+Forgael. Have I not given
+More riches than they ever hoped to find?
+And now they will not follow, while I seek
+The only riches that have hit my fancy.
+Aibric. What riches can you find in this waste sea
+Where no ship sails, where nothing that's alive
+Has ever come but those man-headed birds,
+Knowing it for the world's end?
+Forgael. Where the world ends
+The mind is made unchanging, for it finds
+Miracle, ecstasy, the impossible hope,
+The flagstone under all, the fire of fires,
+The roots of the world.
+Aibric. Shadows before now
+Have driven travellers mad for their own sport.
+Forgael. Do you, too, doubt me? Have you joined their
+plot?
+Aibric. No, no, do not say that.  You know right well
+That I will never lift a hand against you.
+Forgael. Why should you be more faithful than the rest,
+Being as doubtful?
+Aibric. I have called you master
+Too many years to lift a hand against you.
+Forgael. Maybe it is but natural to doubt me.
+You've never known, I'd lay a wager on it,
+A melancholy that a cup of wine,
+A lucky battle, or a woman's kiss
+Could not amend.
+Aibric. I have good spirits enough.
+Forgael. If you will give me all your mind awhile --
+All, all, the very bottom of the bowl --
+I'll show you that I am made differently,
+That nothing can amend it but these waters,
+Where I am rid of life -- the events of the world --
+What do you call it? -- that old promise-breaker,
+The cozening fortune-teller that comes whispering,
+'You will have all you have wished for when you have
+earned
+Land for your children or money in a pot.-
+And when we have it we are no happier,
+Because of that old draught under the door,
+Or creaky shoes.  And at the end of all
+How are we better off than Seaghan the fool,
+That never did a hand's turn? Aibric! Aibric!
+We have fallen in the dreams the Ever-living
+Breathe on the burnished mirror of the world
+And then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh,
+And find their laughter sweeter to the taste
+For that brief sighing.
+Aibric. If you had loved some woman --
+Forgael. You say that also? You have heard the voices,
+For that is what they say -- all, all the shadows --
+Aengus and Edain, those passionate wanderers,
+And all the others; but it must be love
+As they have known it.  Now the secret's out;
+For it is love that I am seeking for,
+But of a beautiful, unheard-of kind
+That is not in the world.
+Aibric. And yet the world
+Has beautiful women to please every man.
+Forgael. But he that gets their love after the fashion
+'Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope
+And bodily tenderness, and finds that even
+The bed of love, that in the imagination
+Had seemed to be the giver of all peace,
+Is no more than a wine-cup in the tasting,
+And as soon finished.
+Aibric. All that ever loved
+Have loved that way -- there is no other way.
+Forgael. Yet never have two lovers kissed but they
+believed there was some other near at hand,
+And almost wept because they could not find it.
+Aibric. When they have twenty years; in middle life
+They take a kiss for what a kiss is worth,
+And let the dream go by.
+Forgael. It's not a dream,
+But the reality that makes our passion
+As a lamp shadow -- no -- no lamp, the sun.
+What the world's million lips are thirsting for
+Must be substantial somewhere.
+Aibric. I have heard the Druids
+Mutter such things as they awake from trance.
+It may be that the Ever-living know it --
+No mortal can.
+Forgael. Yes; if they give us help.
+Aibric. They are besotting you as they besot
+The crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows
+That he has been all night upon the hills,
+Riding to hurley, or in the battle-host
+With the Ever-living.
+Forgael. What if he speak the truth,
+And for a dozen hours have been a part
+Of that more powerful life?
+Aibric, His wife knows better.
+Has she not seen him lying like a log,
+Or fumbling in a dream about the house?
+And if she hear him mutter of wild riders,
+She knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing
+That set him to the fancy.
+Forgael. All would be well
+Could we but give us wholly to the dreams,
+And get into their world that to the sense
+Is shadow, and not linger wretchedly
+Among substantial things; for it is dreams
+That lift us to the flowing, changing world
+That the heart longs for.  What is love itself,
+Even though it be the lightest of light love,
+But dreams that hurry from beyond the world
+To make low laughter more than meat and drink,
+Though it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer,
+Could we but mix ourselves into a dream,
+Not in its image on the mirror!
+Aibric. While
+We're in the body that's impossible.
+Forgael. And yet I cannot think they're leading me
+To death; for they that promised to me love
+As those that can outlive the moon have known it, '
+Had the world's total life gathered up, it seemed,
+Into their shining limbs -- I've had great teachers.
+Aengus and Edain ran up out of the wave --
+You'd never doubt that it was life they promised
+Had you looked on them face to face as I did,
+With so red lips, and running on such feet,
+And having such wide-open, shining eyes.
+Aibric. It's certain they are leading you to death.
+None but the dead, or those that never lived,
+Can know that ecstasy.  Forgael! Forgael!
+They have made you follow the man-headed birds,
+And you have told me that their journey lies
+Towards the country of the dead.
+Forgael. What matter
+If I am going to my death? -- for there,
+Or somewhere, I shall find the love they have
+promised.
+That much is certain.  I shall find a woman.
+One of the Ever-living, as I think --
+One of the Laughing People -- and she and I
+Shall light upon a place in the world's core,
+Where passion grows to be a changeless thing,
+Like charmed apples made of chrysoprase,
+Or chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysclite;
+And there, in juggleries of sight and sense,
+Become one movement, energy, delight,
+Until the overburthened moon is dead.
+[A number of Sailors entcr hurriedly.]
+First Sailor. Look there! there in the mist! a ship of spice!
+And we are almost on her!
+Second Sailor. We had not known
+But for the ambergris and sandalwood.
+First Sailor. NO; but opoponax and cinnamon.
+Forgael [taking the tiller from Aibric]. The Ever-living have
+kept my bargain for me,
+And paid you on the nail.
+Aibric. Take up that rope
+To make her fast while we are plundering her.
+First Sailor. There is a king and queen upon her deck,
+And where there is one woman there'll be others.
+Aibric. Speak lower, or they'll hear.
+First Sailor. They cannot hear;
+They are too busy with each other.  Look!
+He has stooped down and kissed her on the lips.
+Second Sailor. When she finds out we have better men
+aboard
+She may not be too sorry in the end.
+First Sailor. She will be like a wild cat; for these queens
+Care more about the kegs of silver and gold
+And the high fame that come to them in marriage,
+Than a strong body and a ready hand.
+Second Sailor. There's nobody is natural but a robber,
+And that is why the world totters about
+Upon its bandy legs.
+Aibric. Run at them now,
+And overpower the crew while yet asleep!
+[The Sailors go out.]
+<1[Voices and thc clashing of swords are heard from the
+other ship, which cannot be seen because of the sail.]
+A Voice. Armed men have come upon us! O I am slain!
+Another Voice. Wake all below!
+Another Voice. Why have you broken our sleep?
+First Voice. Armed men have come upon us! O I am
+slain!
+Forgael [who has remained at the tiller]. There! there they
+come! Gull, gannet, or diver,
+But with a man's head, or a fair woman's,
+They hover over the masthead awhile
+To wait their Fiends; but when their friends have
+come
+They'll fly upon that secret way of theirs.
+One -- and one -- a couple -- five together;
+And I will hear them talking in a minute.
+Yes, voices! but I do not catch the words.
+Now I can hear.  There's one of them that says,
+'How light we are, now we are changed to birds!'
+Another answers, 'Maybe we shall find
+Our heart's desire now that we are so light.'
+And then one asks another how he died,
+And says, 'A sword-blade pierced me in my sleep.-
+And now they all wheel suddenly and fly
+To the other side, and higher in the air.
+And now a laggard with a woman's head
+dGmes crying, 'I have run upon the sword.
+I have fled to my beloved in the air,
+In the waste of the high air, that we may wander
+Among the windy meadows of the dawn.'
+But why are they still waiting? why are they
+Circling and circling over the masthead?
+What power that is more mighty than desire
+To hurry to their hidden happiness
+Withholds them now? Have the Ever-living Ones
+A meaning in that circling overhead?
+But what's the meaning? [He cries out.] Why do you
+linger there?
+Why linger? Run to your desire,
+Are you not happy winged bodies now?
+[His voice sinks again.]
+Being too busy in the air and the high air,
+They cannot hear my voice; but what's the meaning?
+<1[The Sailors have returned.  Dectora is with them.]
+Forgael [turning and seeing her].>1 Why are you standing
+with your eyes upon me?
+You are not the world's core.  O no, no, no!
+That cannot be the meaning of the birds.
+You are not its core.  My teeth are in the world,
+But have not bitten yet.
+Dectora. I am a queen,
+And ask for satisfaction upon these
+Who have slain my husband and laid hands upon me.
+[Breaking loose from the Sailors who are holding her.]
+Let go my hands!
+Forgael. Why do you cast a shadow?
+Where do you come from? Who brought you to this
+place?
+They would not send me one that casts a shadow.
+Dectora. Would that the storm that overthrew my ships,
+And drowned the treasures of nine conquered nations,
+And blew me hither to my lasting sorrow,
+Had drowned me also.  But, being yet alive,
+I ask a fitting punishment for all
+That raised their hands against him.
+Forgael. There are some
+That weigh and measure all in these waste seas --
+They that have all the wisdom that's in life,
+And all that prophesying images
+Made of dim gold rave out in secret tombs;
+They have it that the plans of kings and queens
+But laughter and tears -- laughter, laughter, and tears;
+That every man should carry his own soul
+Upon his shoulders.
+Dectora. You've nothing but wild words,
+And I would know if you will give me vengeance.
+Forgael. When she finds out I will not let her go --
+When she knows that.
+Dectora. What is it that you are muttering --
+That you'll not let me go? I am a queen.
+Forgael. Although you are more beautiful than any,
+I almost long that it were possible;
+But if I were to put you on that ship,
+With sailors that were sworn to do your will,
+And you had spread a sail for home, a wind
+Would rise of a sudden, or a wave so huge
+It had washed among the stars and put them out,
+And beat the bulwark of your ship on mine,
+Until you stood before me on the deck --
+As now.
+Dectora. Does wandering in these desolate seas
+And listening to the cry of wind and wave
+Bring madness?
+Forgael. Queen, I am not mad.
+Dectora. Yet say
+That unimaginable storms of wind and wave
+Would rise against me.
+Forgael. No, I am not mad --
+If it be not that hearing messages
+From lasting watchers, that outlive the moon,
+At the most quiet midnight is to be stricken.
+Dectora. And did those watchers bid you take me
+captive?
+Forgael. Both you and I are taken in the net.
+It was their hands that plucked the winds awake
+And blew you hither; and their mouths have
+promised
+I shall have love in their immortal fashion;
+And for this end they gave me my old harp
+That is more mighty than the sun and moon,
+Or than the shivering casting-net of the stars,
+That none might take you from me.
+<1Dectora [first trembling back from the mast where the harp is,
+and then laughing].>1 For a moment
+Your raving of a message and a harp
+More mighty than the stars half troubled me,
+But all that's raving.  Who is there can compel
+The daughter and the granddaughter of kings
+To be his bedfellow?
+Forgael. Until your lips
+Have called me their beloved, I'll not kiss them.
+Dectora. My husband and miy king died at my feet,
+And yet you talk of love.
+Forgael. The movement of time
+Is shaken in these seas, and what one does
+One moment has no might upon the moment
+That follows after.
+Dectora. I understand you now.
+You have a Druid craft of wicked sound
+Wrung from the cold women of the sea --
+A magic that can call a demon up,
+Until my body give you kiss for kiss.
+Forgael. Your soul shall give the kiss.
+Dectora. I am not afraid,
+While there's a rope to run into a noose
+Or wave to drown.  But I have done with words,
+And I would have you look into my face
+And know that it is fearless.
+Forgael. Do what you will,
+For neither I nor you can break a mesh
+Of the great golden net that is about us.
+Dectora. There's nothing in the world that's worth a
+fear.
+<1[She passes Forgael and stands for a moment looking into
+his face.]>1
+I have good reason for that thought.
+[She runs suddenly on to the raiscd part of the poop.]
+And now
+I can put fear away as a queen should.
+<1[She mounts on to the hulwark and turns towards
+Forgael.]>1
+Fool, fool! Although you have looked into my face
+You do not see my purpose.  I shall have gone
+Before a hand can touch me.
+Forgael [folding his arms]. My hands are still;
+The Ever-living hold us.  Do what you will,
+You cannot leap out of the golden net.
+First Sailor. No need to drown, for, if you will pardon
+us
+And measure out a course and bring us home,
+We'll put this man to death.
+Dectora. I promise it.
+First Sailor. There is none to take his side.
+Aibric. I am on his side,
+I'll strike a blow for him to give him time
+To cast his dreams away.
+<1[Aibric goes in front of Forgael with drawn sword.  For-
+gael takes the harp.]>1
+First Sailor. No other'll do it.
+<1[The Sailors throw Aibric on one side.  He falls and lies
+upon the deck.  They lift their swords to strike Forgael,>1
+<1who is about to play the harp.  The stage begins to
+darken.  The Sailors hesitate in fear.]
+Second Sailor.>1 He has put a sudden darkness over the
+moon.
+Dectora. Nine swords with handles of rhinoceros horn
+To him that strikes him first!
+First Sailor. I will strike him first.
+<1[He goes close up to Forgael with his sword lifted.]
+[Shrinking back.] He has caught the crescent moon out
+of the sky,
+And carries it between us.
+Second Sailor. Holy fire
+To burn us to the marrow if we strike.
+Dectora. I'll give a golden galley full of fruit,
+That has the heady flavour of new wine,
+To him that wounds him to the death.
+First Sailor. I'll do it.
+For all his spells will vanish when he dies,
+Having their life in him.
+Second Sailor. Though it be the moon
+That he is holding up between us there,
+I will strike at him.
+The Others. And I! And I! And I!
+[Forgael plays the harp.]
+First Sailor [falling into a dream suddenly. But you were
+saying there is somebody
+Upon that other ship we are to wake.
+You did not know what brought him to his end,
+But it was sudden.
+Second Sailor. You are in the right;
+I had forgotten that we must go wake him.
+Dectora. He has flung a Druid spell upon the air,
+And set you dreaming.
+Second Sailor. How can we have a wake
+When we have neither brown nor yellow ale?
+First Sailor. I saw a flagon of brown ale aboard her.
+Third Sailor. How can we raise the keen that do not
+know
+What name to call him by?
+First Sailor. Come to his ship.
+His name will come into our thoughts in a minute.
+I know that he died a thousand years ago,
+And has not yet been waked.
+Second Sailor [beginning to keen]. Ohone! O! O! O!
+The yew-bough has been broken into two,
+And all the birds are scattered.
+All the Sailors. O! O! O! O!
+[They go out keening.]
+Dectora. Protect me now, gods that my people swear by.
+<1[Aibric has risen from the deck where he had fallen.  He
+has begun looking for his sword as if in a dream.]>1
+Aibric. Where is my sword that fell out of my hand
+When I first heard the news? Ah, there it is!
+<1[He goes dreamily towards the sword, but Dectora runs at
+it and takes it up before he can reach it.]>1
+Aibric [sleepily]. Queen, give it me.
+Dectora. No, I have need of it.
+Aibric. Why do you need a sword? But you may keep it.
+Now that he's dead I have no need of it,
+For everything is gone.
+A Sailor [calling from the other ship]. Come hither, Aibric,
+And tell me who it is that we are waking.
+Aibric [half to Dectora, half to himself]. What name had
+that dead king? Arthur of Britain?
+No, no -- not Arthur.  I remember now.
+It was golden-armed Iollan, and he died
+Broken-hearted, having lost his queen
+Through wicked spells.  That is not all the tale,
+For he was killed.  O! O! O! O! O! O!
+For golden-armed Iollan has been killed.
+<1[He goes out.]
+[While he has been speaking, and through part of what
+follows, one hears the wailing of the Sailors from the
+other ship.  Dectora stands with the sword lifted in
+front of Forgael.]>1
+Dectora. I will end all your magic on the instant.
+<1[Her voice hecomes dreamy, and she lowers the sword
+slowly, and finally lets it fall.  She spreads out her hair.
+She takes off her crown and lays it upon the deck.]>1
+This sword is to lie beside him in the grave.
+It was in all his battles.  I will spread my hair,
+And wring my hands, and wail him bitterly,
+For I have heard that he was proud and laughing,
+Blue-eyed, and a quick runner on bare feet,
+And that he died a thousand years ago.
+O; O! O! O!
+[Forgael changes the tune.]
+But no, that is not it.
+They killed him at my feet.  O! O! O! O!
+For golden-armed Iollan that I loved-
+But what is it that made me say I loved him?
+It was that harper put it in my thoughts,
+But it is true.  Why did they run upon him,
+And beat the golden helmet with their swords?
+Forgael. Do you not know me, lady? I am he
+That you are weeping for.
+Dectora. No, for he is dcad.
+O! O! O! O! for golden-armed Iollan.
+Forgael. It was so given out, but I will prove
+That the grave-diggers in a dreamy frenzy
+Have buried nothing but my golden arms.
+Listen to that low-laughing string of the moon
+And you will recollect my face and voice,
+For you have listened to me playing it
+These thousand years.
+<1[He starts up, listening to the birds.  The harp slips from
+his hands, and remains leaning against the bulwarks
+behind him.]>1
+What are the birds at there?
+Why are they all a-flutter of a sudden?
+What are you calling out above the mast?
+If railing and reproach and mockery
+Because I have awakened her to love
+By magic strings, I'll make this answer to it:
+Being driven on by voices and by dreams
+That were clear messages from the Ever-living,
+I have done right.  What could I but obey?
+And yet you make a clamour of reproach.
+Dcctora [laughing]. Why, it's a wonder out of reckoning
+That I should keen him from the full of the moon
+To the horn, and he be hale and hearty.
+Forgael. How have I wronged her now that she is merry?
+But no, no, no! your cry is not against me.
+You know the counsels of the Ever-living,
+And all that tossing of your wings is joy,
+And all that murmuring's but a marriage-song;
+But if it be reproach, I answer this:
+There is not one among you that made love
+by any other means.  You call it passion,
+Consideration, generosity;
+But it was all deceit, and flattery
+To win a woman in her own despite,
+For love is war, and there is hatred in it;
+And if you say that she came willingly --
+Dectora. Why do you turn away and hide your face,
+That I would look upon for ever?
+Forgael. My grief!
+Dectora. Have I not loved you for a thousand years?
+Forgael. I never have been golden-armed Iollan.
+Vectora. I do not understand.  I know your face
+Better than my own hands.
+Forgael. I have deceived you
+Out of all reckoning.
+Tectora. Is it not tme
+That you were born a thousand years ago,
+In islands where the children of Aengus wind
+In happy dances under a windy moon,
+And that you'll bring me there?
+Forgael. I have deceived you;
+I have deceived you utterly.
+Dectora. How can that be?
+Is it that though your eyes are full of love
+Some other woman has a claim on you,
+And I've but half!
+Forgael. O no!
+Dectora. And if there is,
+If there be half a hundred more, what matter?
+I'll never give another thought to it;
+No, no, nor half a thought; but do not speak.
+Women are hard and proud and stubborn-hearted,
+Their heads being turned with praise and flattery;
+And that is why their lovers are afraid
+To tell them a plain story.
+Forgael. That's not the story;
+But I have done so great a wrong against you,
+There is no measure that it would not burst.
+I will confess it all.
+Dectora. What do I care,
+Now that my body has begun to dream,
+And you have grown to be a burning sod
+In the imagination and intellect?
+If something that's most fabulous were true --
+If you had taken me by magic spells,
+And killed a lover or husband at my feet --
+I would not let you speak, for I would know
+That it was yesterday and not to-day
+I loved him; I would cover up my ears,
+As I am doing now.  [A pause.] Why do you weep?
+Forgael. I weep because I've nothing for your eyes
+But desolate waters and a battered ship.
+Dectora. O why do you not lift your eyes to mine?
+Forgael. I weep -- I weep because bare night's above,
+And not a roof of ivory and gold.
+Dectora. I would grow jealous of the ivory roof,
+And strike the golden pillars with my hands.
+I would that there was nothing in the world
+But my beloved -- that night and day had perished,
+And all that is and all that is to be,
+All that is not the meeting of our lips.
+Forgael. You turn away.  Why do you turn away?
+Am I to fear the waves, or is the moon
+My enemy?
+Dectora. I looked upon the moon,
+Longing to knead and pull it into shape
+That I might lay it on your head as a crown.
+But now it is your thoughts that wander away,
+For you are looking at the sea.  Do you not know
+How great a wrong it is to let one's thought
+Wander a moment when one is in love?
+<1[He has moved away.  She follows him.  He is looking out
+over the sea, shading his eyes.]>1
+Why are you looking at the sea?
+Forgael. Look there!
+Dectora. What is there but a troop of ash-grey birds
+That fly into the west?
+Forgael. But listen, listen!
+Dectora. What is there but the crying of the birds?
+Forgael. If you'll but listen closely to that crying
+You'll hear them calling out to one another
+With human voices
+Dectora. O, I can hear them now.
+What are they? Unto what country do they fly?
+Forgael. To unimaginable happiness.
+They have been circling over our heads in the air,
+But now that they have taken to the road
+We have to follow, for they are our pilots;
+And though they're but the colour of grey ash,
+They're crying out, could you but hear their words,
+'There is a country at the end of the world
+Where no child's born but to outlive the moon.'
+<1[The Sailors comc in with Aibric.  They are in great
+excitement.]>1
+First Sailor. The hold is full of treasure.
+Second Sailor. Full to the hatches.
+First Sailor. Treasure on treasure.
+Third Sailor. Boxes of precious spice.
+First Sailor. Ivory images with amethyst eyes.
+Third Sailor. Dragons with eyes of ruby.
+First Sailor. The whole ship
+Flashes as if it were a net of herrings.
+Third Sailor. Let's home; I'd give some rubies to a
+woman.
+Second Sailor. There's somebody I'd give the amethyst
+eyes to.
+Aibric [silencing thcm with agesture]. We would return to
+our own country, Forgael,
+For we have found a treasure that's so great
+Imagination cannot reckon it.
+And having lit upon this woman there,
+What more have you to look for on the seas?
+Forgael. I cannot -- I am going on to the end.
+As for this woman, I think she is coming with me.
+Aibric. The Ever-living have made you mad; but no,
+It was this woman in her woman's vengeance
+That drove you to it, and I fool enough
+To fancy that she'd bring you home again.
+'Twas you that egged him to it, for you know
+That he is being driven to his death.
+Dectora. That is not true, for he has promised me
+An unimaginable happiness.
+Aibric. And if that happiness be more than dreams,
+More than the froth, the feather, the dust-whirl,
+The crazy nothing that I think it is,
+It shall be in the country of the dead,
+If there be such a country.
+Dectora. No, not there,
+But in some island where the life of the world
+Leaps upward, as if all the streams o' the world
+Had run into one fountain.
+Aibric. Speak to him.
+He knows that he is taking you to death;
+Speak -- he will not deny it.
+Dectora. Is that true?
+Forgael. I do not know for certain, but I know.
+That I have the best of pilots.
+Aibric. Shadows, illusions,
+That the Shape-changers, the Ever-laughing Ones,
+The Immortal Mockers have cast into his mind,
+Or called before his eyes.
+Dectora. O carry me
+To some sure country, some familia'r place.
+Have we not everything that life can give
+In having one another?
+Forgael. How could I rest
+If I refused the messengers and pilots
+With all those sights and all that crying out?
+Dectora. But I will cover up your eyes and ear?,
+That you may never hear the cry of the birds,
+Or look upon them.
+Forgael. Were they but lowlier
+I'd do your will, but they are too high -- too high.
+Dectora. Being too high, their heady prophecies
+But harry us with hopes that come to nothing,
+Because we are not proud, imperishable,
+Alone and winged.
+Forgael. Our love shall be like theirs
+When we have put their changeless image on.
+Dectora. I am a woman, I die at every breath.
+Aibric. Let the birds scatter, for the tree is broken,
+And there's no help in words.  [To the Sailors.]
+To the other ship,
+And I will follow you and cut the rope
+When I have said farewell to this man here,
+For neither I nor any living man
+Will look upon his face again.
+[The Sailors go out.]
+Forgael [to Dectora], Go with him,
+For he will shelter you and bring you home.
+Aibric [taking Forgael's hand]. I'll do it for his sake.
+Dectora. No.  Take this sword
+And cut the rope, for I go on with Forgael.
+Aibric [half falling into the keen]. The yew-bough has been
+broken into two,
+And all the birds are scattered -- O! O! O!
+Farewell! farewell! [He goes out.]
+Dectora. The sword is in the rope --
+The rope's in two -- it falls into the sea,
+It whirls into the foam.  O ancient worm,
+Dragon that loved the world and held us to it,
+You are broken, you are broken.  The world drifts
+away,
+And I am left alone with my beloved,
+Who cannot put me from his sight for ever.
+We are alone for ever, and I laugh,
+Forgael, because you cannot put me from you.
+The mist has covered the heavens, and you and I
+Shall be alone for ever.  We two -- this crown --
+I half remember.  It has been in my dreams.
+Bend lower, O king, that I may crown you with it.
+O flower of the branch, 0 bird among the leaves,
+O silver fish that my two hands have taken
+Out of the running stream, O morning star
+Trembling in the blue heavens like a white fawn
+Upon the misty border of the wood,
+Bend lower, that I may cover you with my hair,
+For we will gaze upon this world no longer.
+Forgael [gathering Dectora's hair about him]. Beloved, hav-
+ing dragged the net about us,
+And knitted mesh to mesh, we grow immortal;
+And that old harp awakens of itself
+To cry aloud to the grey birds, and dreams,
+That have had dreams for father, live in us.

+"I have been one acquainted with the night" - Robert Frost
+Rode in the train all night, in the sick light. A bird
+Flew parallel with a singular will. In daydream's moods and
+attitudes
+The other passengers slumped, dozed, slept, read,
+Waiting, and waiting for place to be displaced
+On the exact track of safety or the rack of accident.
+Looked out at the night, unable to distinguish
+Lights in the towns of passage from the yellow lights
+Numb on the ceiling. And the bird flew parallel and still
+As the train shot forth the straight line of its whistle,
+Forward on the taut tracks, piercing empty, familiar --
+The bored center of this vision and condition looked and
+looked
+Down through the slick pages of the magazine (seeking
+The seen and the unseen) and his gaze fell down the well
+Of the great darkness under the slick glitter,
+And he was only one among eight million riders and
+readers.
+And all the while under his empty smile the shaking drum
+Of the long determined passage passed through him
+By his body mimicked and echoed. And then the train
+Like a suddenly storming rain, began to rush and thresh--
+The silent or passive night, pressing and impressing
+The patients' foreheads with a tightening-like image
+Of the rushing engine proceeded by a shaft of light
+Piercing the dark, changing and transforming the silence
+Into a violence of foam, sound, smoke and succession.
+A bored child went to get a cup of water,
+And crushed the cup because the water too was
+Boring and merely boredom's struggle.
+The child, returning, looked over the shoulder
+Of a man reading until he annoyed the shoulder.
+A fat woman yawned and felt the liquid drops
+Drip down the fleece of many dinners.
+And the bird flew parallel and parallel flew
+The black pencil lines of telephone posts, crucified,
+At regular intervals, post after post
+Of thrice crossed, blue-belled, anonymous trees.
+And then the bird cried as if to all of us:
+0 your life, your lonely life
+What have you ever done with it,
+And done with the great gift of consciousness?
+What will you ever do with your life before death's
+knife
+Provides the answer ultimate and appropriate?
+As I for my part felt in my heart as one who falls,
+Falls in a parachute, falls endlessly, and feel the vast
+Draft of the abyss sucking him down and down,
+An endlessly helplessly falling and appalled clown:
+This is the way that night passes by, this
+Is the overnight endless trip to the famous unfathomable
+abyss.

+There was me,

+As we waited for a sister after being concieved,
+Just recently we had bought a camera,
+We stocked up on VHS tapes,
+So many laughs and so much anger,
+When living room boxing went on so late.
+I remember a day out
+The zoo is where we went
+The goat ate my bag instead of the food
+And tried to eat my coat through the fence.
+Me and my brothers never got along
+But what brothers do
+We punched and shouted until we'd hurt,
+But looked out for each other to,
+My eldest was always grounded
+coz he was a rebel on the streets,
+He'd get his opinion across,

+Felt all that was within, the dread and lonely pain
+Fore seeing all the grey clouds, and endless rain
+In an entrapment of her bleak, bedroom place
+Many scratches of finger nails, adorned her face
+Scars of the tormented, and that without release
+Collected them like dolls, upon skin like a crease
+Sunken eyes reflecting, the soul of a sunken heart
+When futures hope seem diminished, and torn apart
+Black lines of her heavy make up, drawn down
+By so many tears, shed beneath her failed crown
+Clasping her wrist, another attempt failed and stings
+The music of her emotion, now in her ear doth rings
+Though destinies sands, of her future are running out
+Upon her lips adorn the kiss, of this deathly spout
+That a dagger drawn from a box, of marble and wood
+In her bedroom undetermined, to whether she should
+The bare trees of autumn, tapping the dark window
+Though to convince her, of an alternative innuendo
+So much has she lost, that her black nails are tight
+Around the handle of this blade, and loosing sight
+That with one last breath, stolen by her searing pain
+Of final thrust, that this blade pierced without a strain
+Into her solemn heart, choking her grief as her blood
+Ran like tears, down her breasts, staining like mud
+Dropping to the floor, like a seed of the dandelion
+Falls upon the winds end, but only to see oblivion
+So much of her last thoughts, as her life ebbs away
+Never shall she see, the beginning of a new born day
+As the time for her life, has slowly begun to stop
+From the blades handle, blood spills dropp by drop
+Silent now, as her body lays still, grey as the sky
+Young was her soul, victimised, too young to die

+I understand the boredom of the clerks
+fatigue shifting like dunes within their eyes
+a frightful nausea gumming up the works
+that once was thought aggression in disguise.
+Do you remember? then how lightly dead
+seemed the moon when over factories
+it languid slid like a barrage of lead
+above the heart, the fierce inventories
+of desire. Now women wander our dreams
+carrying money and to our sleep's shame
+our hands twitch not for swift blood-sunk triremes
+nor languorous white horses nor ill fame,
+but clutch the groin that clouds a pallid sky
+where tow'rs are sinking in their common eye.
+2
+My ship is flung upon the gutter's wrist
+and cries for help of storm to violate
+that flesh your curiosity too late
+has flushed. The stem your garter tongue would twist
+has sunk upon the waveless bosom's mist,
+thigh of the city, apparition, hate,
+and the tower whose doves have, delicate,
+fled into my blood where they are not kissed.
+You have left me to the sewer's meanwhile,
+and I have answered the sea's open wish
+to love me as a bonfire's watchful hand
+guards red the shore and guards the hairy strand,
+our most elegant lascivious bile,
+my ship sinking beneath the gutter's fish.
+3
+How can I then, my dearest winter lay,
+disgorge the tasty worm that eats me up
+falling onto the stem of a highway
+whose ardent rainbow is the spoon's flat cup
+and in the vilest of blue suited force
+enamored of the heated needle's arm
+finds the ministrant an own tongue's remorse
+so near the blood and still so far from harm,
+thus to be eaten up and gobbled down
+volcanoes of speedometers, the strike
+that heats the iris into flame and flow'rs
+the panting chalice so a turning pike:
+you are not how the gods refused to die,
+and I am scarred forever neath the eye.
+4
+What are my eyes? if they must feed me, rank
+with forgetting, in the jealous forest
+of lustrous blows, so luminously blank
+through smoke and in the light. All faint, at rest,
+yet I am racing towards the fear that kills
+them off, friends and lovers, hast'ning through tears
+like alcohol high in the throat of hills
+and hills of night, alluring! their black cheers
+falling upon my ears like nails. And there
+the bars grow thick with onanists and camps
+and bivouacs of bears with clubs, are fair
+with their blows, deal death beneath purple lamps
+and to me! I run! closer always move,
+crying my name in fields of dead I love.
+5
+I plunge deep within this frozen lake
+whose mirrored fastnesses fill up my heart,
+where tears drift from frivolity to art
+all white and slobbering, and by mistake
+are the sky. I'm no whale to cruise apart
+in fields impassive of my stench, my sake,
+my sign to crushing seas that fall like fake
+pillars to crash! to sow as wake my heart
+and don't be niggardly. The snow drifts low
+and yet neglects to cover me, and I
+dance just ahead to keep my heart in sight.
+How like a queen, to seek with jealous eye
+the face that flees you, hidden city, white
+swan. There's no art to free me, blinded so.

+Of smoke and rain, an insubstantial threat

+Warmed by a wry desire, a kind of love.
+I see the trams, like galleons at night,
+Go rocking with their golden cargo down

+Of phantom guests – the smells of fish and chips,

+And in that city through a forked November
+Love, like a Catherine-wheel, delighted me
+And when it sputtered out, hung charred and sombre,
+The city flavoured my delicious misery.
+And so I guess that any landscape"s beauty
+Is fathered by associative joys
+Held in a shared, historic memory,

+Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought,
+Through contemplation of those goodly sights,
+And glorious images in heaven wrought,
+Whose wondrous beauty, breathing sweet delights
+Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights;
+I fain to tell the things that I behold,
+But feel my wits to fail, and tongue to fold.
+Vouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright,
+From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow,
+To shed into my breast some sparkling light
+Of thine eternal truth, that I may show
+Some little beams to mortal eyes below
+Of that immortal beauty, there with thee,
+Which in my weak distraughted mind I see;
+That with the glory of so goodly sight
+The hearts of men, which fondly here admire
+Fair seeming shews, and feed on vain delight,
+Transported with celestial desire
+Of those fair forms, may lift themselves up higher,
+And learn to love, with zealous humble duty,
+Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.
+Beginning then below, with th' easy view
+Of this base world, subject to fleshly eye,
+From thence to mount aloft, by order due,
+To contemplation of th' immortal sky;
+Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly,
+That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,
+Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.
+Then look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed
+With sight of that is fair, look on the frame
+Of this wide universe, and therein reed
+The endless kinds of creatures which by name
+Thou canst not count, much less their natures aim;
+All which are made with wondrous wise respect,
+And all with admirable beauty deckt.
+First th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded,
+Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands;
+Then th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded
+On every side, with piles of flaming brands,
+Never consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands;
+And last, that mighty shining crystal wall,
+Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.
+By view whereof it plainly may appear,
+That still as every thing doth upward tend,
+And further is from earth, so still more clear
+And fair it grows, till to his perfect end
+Of purest beauty it at last ascend;
+Air more than water, fire much more than air,
+And heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair.
+Look thou no further, but affix thine eye
+On that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass,
+The house of blessed gods, which men call sky,
+All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass,
+Whereof each other doth in brightness pass,
+But those two most, which ruling night and day,
+As king and queen, the heavens' empire sway;
+And tell me then, what hast thou ever seen
+That to their beauty may compared be,
+Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen
+Endure their captain's flaming head to see?
+How much less those, much higher in degree,
+And so much fairer, and much more than these,
+As these are fairer than the land and seas?
+For far above these heavens, which here we see,
+Be others far exceeding these in light,
+Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,
+But infinite in largeness and in height,
+Unmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright,
+That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres,
+But their own native light far passing theirs.
+And as these heavens still by degrees arise,
+Until they come to their first Mover's bound,
+That in his mighty compass doth comprise,
+And carry all the rest with him around;
+So those likewise do by degrees redound,
+And rise more fair; till they at last arrive
+To the most fair, whereto they all do strive.
+Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place,
+In full enjoyment of felicity,
+Whence they do still behold the glorious face
+Of the divine eternal Majesty;
+More fair is that, where those Ideas on high
+Enranged be, which Plato so admired,
+And pure Intelligences from God inspired.
+Yet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign
+The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,
+Which in their high protections do contain
+All mortal princes and imperial states;
+And fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats
+And heavenly Dominations are set,
+From whom all earthly governance is fet.
+Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,
+Which all with golden wings are overdight,
+And those eternal burning Seraphins,
+Which from their faces dart out fiery light;
+Yet fairer than they both, and much more bright,
+Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend
+On God's own person, without rest or end.
+These thus in fair each other far excelling,
+As to the highest they approach more near,
+Yet is that highest far beyond all telling,
+Fairer than all the rest which there appear,
+Though all their beauties join'd together were;
+How then can mortal tongue hope to express
+The image of such endless perfectness?
+Cease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind
+Leave to bethink how great that beauty is,
+Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find;
+How much more those essential parts of his,
+His truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,
+His grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,
+By which he lends us of himself a sight.
+Those unto all he daily doth display,
+And shew himself in th' image of his grace,
+As in a looking-glass, through which he may
+Be seen of all his creatures vile and base,
+That are unable else to see his face,
+His glorious face which glistereth else so bright,
+That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.
+But we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain
+The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,
+But that their points rebutted back again
+Are dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne
+The glory of that Majesty Divine,
+In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,
+Compared to his least resplendent spark?
+The means, therefore, which unto us is lent
+Him to behold, is on his works to look,
+Which he hath made in beauty excellent,
+And in the same, as in a brazen book,
+To read enregister'd in every nook
+His goodness, which his beauty doth declare;
+For all that's good is beautiful and fair.
+Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,
+To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,
+Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,
+From this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,
+And, like the native brood of eagles' kind,
+On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,
+Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.
+Humbled with fear and awful reverence,
+Before the footstool of his majesty
+Throw thyself down, with trembling innocence,
+Ne dare look up with corruptible eye
+On the dread face of that great Deity,
+For fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,
+Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.
+But lowly fall before his mercy seat,
+Close covered with the Lamb's integrity
+From the just wrath of his avengeful threat
+That sits upon the righteous throne on high;
+His throne is built upon eternity,
+More firm and durable than steel or brass,
+Or the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.
+His sceptre is the rod of righteousness,
+With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,
+And the great Dragon strongly doth repress,
+Under the rigour of his judgement just;
+His seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,
+From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright
+That all about him sheddeth glorious light:
+Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark
+Which darted is from Titan's flaming head,
+That with his beams enlumineth the dark
+And dampish air, whereby all things are read;
+Whose nature yet so much is marvelled
+Of mortal wits, that it doth much amaze
+The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.
+But that immortal light, which there doth shine,
+Is many thousand times more bright, more clear,
+More excellent, more glorious, more divine,
+Through which to God all mortal actions here,
+And even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;
+For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,
+Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.
+With the great glory of that wondrous light
+His throne is all encompassed around,
+And hid in his own brightness from the sight
+Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound;
+And underneath his feet are to be found
+Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,
+The instruments of his avenging ire.
+There in his bosom Sapience doth sit,
+The sovereign darling of the Deity,
+Clad like a queen in royal robes, most fit
+For so great power and peerless majesty,
+And all with gems and jewels gorgeously
+Adorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,
+And make her native brightness seem more clear.
+And on her head a crown of purest gold
+Is set, in sign of highest sovereignty;
+And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,
+With which she rules the house of God on high,
+And manageth the ever-moving sky,
+And in the same these lower creatures all
+Subjected to her power imperial.
+Both heaven and earth obey unto her will,
+And all the creatures which they both contain;
+For of her fullness which the world doth fill
+They all partake, and do in state remain
+As their great Maker did at first ordain,
+Through observation of her high behest,
+By which they first were made, and still increast.
+The fairness of her face no tongue can tell;
+For she the daughters of all women's race,
+And angels eke, in beauty doth excel,
+Sparkled on her from God's own glorious face,
+And more increas'd by her own goodly grace,
+That it doth far exceed all human thought,
+Ne can on earth compared be to aught.
+Ne could that painter (had he lived yet)
+Which pictured Venus with so curious quill,
+That all posterity admired it,
+Have portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill;
+Ne she herself, had she remained still,
+And were as fair as fabling wits do feign,
+Could once come near this beauty sovereign.
+But had those wits, the wonders of their days,
+Or that sweet Teian poet, which did spend
+His plenteous vein in setting forth her praise,
+Seen but a glimpse of this which I pretend,
+How wondrously would he her face commend,
+Above that idol of his feigning thought,
+That all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.
+How then dare I, the novice of his art,
+Presume to picture so divine a wight,
+Or hope t' express her least perfection's part,
+Whose beauty fills the heavens with her light,
+And darks the earth with shadow of her sight?
+Ah, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint
+The portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.
+Let angels, which her goodly face behold
+And see at will, her sovereign praises sing,
+And those most sacred mysteries unfold
+Of that fair love of mighty heaven's King;
+Enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing,
+And being thus with her huge love possest,
+In th' only wonder of herself to rest.
+But whoso may, thrice happy man him hold,
+Of all on earth whom God so much doth grace
+And lets his own beloved to behold;
+For in the view of her celestial face
+All joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place;
+Ne aught on earth can want unto the wight
+Who of herself can win the wishful sight.
+For she, out of her secret treasury,
+Plenty of riches forth on him will pour,
+Even heavenly riches, which there hidden lie
+Within the closet of her chastest bower,
+Th' eternal portion of her precious dower,
+Which mighty God hath given to her free,
+And to all those which thereof worthy be.
+None thereof worthy be, but those whom she
+Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive,
+And letteth them her lovely face to see,
+Whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive,
+And sweet contentment, that it doth bereave
+Their soul of sense, through infinite delight,
+And them transport from flesh into the spright.
+In which they see such admirable things,
+As carries them into an ecstasy,
+And hear such heavenly notes, and carollings
+Of God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky;
+And feel such joy and pleasure inwardly,
+That maketh them all worldly cares forget,
+And only think on that before them set.
+Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense,
+Or idle thought of earthly things, remain;
+But all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence,
+And all that pleased erst now seems to pain;
+Their joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain,
+Is fixed all on that which now they see;
+All other sights but feigned shadows be.
+And that fair lamp, which useth to inflame
+The hearts of men with self-consuming fire
+Thenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame;
+And all that pomp to which proud minds aspire
+By name of honour, and so much desire,
+Seems to them baseness, and all riches dross,
+And all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss.
+So full their eyes are of that glorious sight,
+And senses fraught with such satiety,
+That in nought else on earth they can delight,
+But in th' aspect of that felicity,
+Which they have written in their inward eye;
+On which they feed, and in their fastened mind
+All happy joy and full contentment find.
+Ah, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed
+On idle fancies of thy foolish thought,
+And, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled,
+Hast after vain deceitful shadows sought,
+Which all are fled, and now have left thee nought
+But late repentance through thy follies prief;
+Ah cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:
+And look at last up to that sovereign light,
+From whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs,
+That kindleth love in every godly sprite,
+Even the love of God, which loathing brings
+Of this vile world and these gay-seeming things;
+With whose sweet pleasures being so possest,
+Thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest.

+What is the song the children sing,
+When doorway lilacs bloom in Spring,
+And the Schools are loosed, and the games are played
+That were deadly earnest when Earth was made?
+Hear them chattering, shrill and hard,
+After dinner-time, out in the yard,
+As the sides are chosen and all submit
+To the chance of the lot that shall make them "It."
+(Singing)
+"Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!
+Catch a nigger by the toe!
+(If he hollers let him go!)
+Eenee, Meenee. Mainee, Mo!
+You-are-It!"
+Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, and Mo
+Were the First Big Four of the Long Ago,
+When the Pole of the Earth sloped thirty degrees,
+And Central Europe began to freeze,
+And they needed Ambassadors staunch and stark
+To steady the Tribes in the gathering dark:
+But the frost was fierce and flesh was frail,
+So they launched a Magic that could not fail.
+(Singing)
+"Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!
+Hear the wolves across the snow!
+Some one has to kill 'em--so
+Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo
+Make--you--It!"
+Slow ly the Glacial Epoch passed,
+Central Europe thawed out at last;
+And, under the slush of the melting snows
+The first dim shapes of the Nations rose.
+Rome, Britannia, Belgium, Gaul--
+Flood and avalanche fathered them all;
+And the First Big Four, as they watched the mess,
+Pitied Man in his helplessness.
+(Singing)
+"Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!
+Trouble starts When Nations grow,
+Some one has to stop it--so
+Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!
+Make-you-It!"
+Thus it happened, but none can tell
+What was the Power behind the spell--
+Fear, or Duty, or Pride, or Faith--
+That sent men shuddering out to death--
+To cold and watching, and, worse than these,
+Work, more work, when they looked for ease--
+To the days discomfort, the nights despair,
+In the hope of a prize that they never could share,
+(Singing)
+"Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!
+Man is born to Toil and Woe.
+One will cure another--so
+Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo
+Make--you--It!"
+Once and again, as the Ice went North
+The grass crept up to the Firth of Forth.
+Once and again, as the Ice came South
+The glaciers ground over Lossiemouth.
+But, grass or glacier, cold or hot,
+The men went out who would rather not,
+And fought with the Tiger, the Pig and the Ape,
+To hammer the world into decent shape.
+(Singing)
+"Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!
+What's the use of doing so?
+Ask the Gods, for we don't know;
+But Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo
+Make-us-It!"
+Nothing is left of that terrible rune
+But a tag of gibberish tacked to a tune
+That ends the waiting and settles the claims
+Of children arguing over their games;
+For never yet has a boy been found
+To shirk his turn when the turn came round;
+Nor even a girl has been known to say
+"If you laugh at me I shan't play."
+For--
+"Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo,
+(Don't you let the grown-ups know!)
+You may hate it ever so,
+But if you're chose you're bound to go,
+When Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo
+Make-you-It!"

+(To Robert Graves)
+I
+Here I'm sitting in the gloom
+Of my quiet attic room.
+France goes rolling all around,
+Fledged with forest May has crowned.
+And I puff my pipe, calm-hearted,
+Thinking how the fighting started,
+Wondering when we'll ever end it,
+Back to hell with Kaiser sent it,
+Gag the noise, pack up and go,
+Clockwork soldiers in a row.
+I've got better things to do
+Than to waste my time on you.
+II
+Robert, when I drowse to-night,
+Skirting lawns of sleep to chase
+Shifting dreams in mazy light,
+Somewhere then I'll see your face
+Turning back to bid me follow
+Where I wag my arms and hollo,
+Over hedges hasting after
+Crooked smile and baffling laughter,
+Running tireless, floating, leaping,
+Down your web-hung woods and valleys,
+Where the glowworm stars are peeping,
+Till I find you, quiet as stone
+On a hill-top all alone,
+Staring outward, gravely pondering
+Jumbled leagues of hillock-wandering.
+III
+You and I have walked together
+In the starving winter weather.
+We've been glad because we knew
+Time's too short and friends are few.
+We've been sad because we missed
+One whose yellow head was kissed
+By the gods, who thought about him
+Till they couldn't do without him.
+Now he's here again; I've been
+Soldier David dressed in green,
+Standing in a wood that swings
+To the madrigal he sings.
+He's come back, all mirth and glory,
+Like the prince in a fairy tory.
+Winter called him far away;
+Blossoms bring him home with May.
+IV
+Well, I know you'll swear it's true
+That you found him decked in blue
+Striding up through morning-land
+With a cloud on either hand.
+Out in Wales, you'll say, he marches
+Arm-in-arm with aoks and larches;
+Hides all night in hilly nooks,
+Laughs at dawn in tumbling brooks.
+Yet, it's certain, here he teaches
+Outpost-schemes to groups of beeches.
+And I'm sure, as here I stand,
+That he shines through every land,
+That he sings in every place
+Where we're thinking of his face.
+V
+Robert, there's a war in France;
+Everywhere men bang and blunder,
+Sweat and swear and worship Chance,
+Creep and blink through cannon thunder.
+Rifles crack and bullets flick,
+Sing and hum like hornet-swarms.
+Bones are smashed and buried quick.
+Yet, through stunning battle storms,
+All the while I watch the spark
+Lit to guide me; for I know
+Dreams will triumph, though the dark
+Scowls above me where I go.
+You can hear me; you can mingle
+Radiant folly with my jingle.
+War's a joke for me and you
+While we know such dreams are true!

+They were amazed at its length
+But no one the snake would touch or take
+They gave me facts every ten minutes about the snake
+And it’s a new species discovered, I learned

+Destiny hopefully knocks on our door at the right time

+when it has tried to give me a chance
+I have become ecstatic and full of light
+ever since destiny came together
+like a puzzle
+I had the box and the pieces in my possession
+but I guess it took a little bit of time
+because I over think
+I over analyze
+I have this unbeatable streak
+of missing destiny's knock on the door
+Well finally I answered and
+everything is coming together
+No missing pieces no bent
+or child manipulated pieces
+Just a brand new box with
+the plastic wrapping right next to it
+with the steep price tag of 31 years
+The pieces are all out

+Everything is there
+Everything is fastened together
+Everything is great
+I apologize to myself

+All roads that lead to God are good.
+What matters it, your faith, or mine?
+Both centre at the goal divine
+Of love’s eternal Brotherhood.
+The kindly life in house or street –
+The life of prayer and mystic rite –
+The student’s search for truth and light –
+These paths at one great Junction meet.
+Before the oldest book was writ,
+Full many a prehistoric soul
+Arrived at this unchanging goal,
+Through changeless Love, that leads to it.
+What matters that one found his Christ
+In rising sun, or burning fire?
+In faith within him did not tire,
+His longing for the Truth sufficed.
+Before our modern hell was brought
+To edify the modern world,
+Full many a hate-filled soul was hurled
+In lakes of fire by its own thought.
+A thousand creeds have come and gone,
+But what is that to you or me?
+Creeds are but branches of a tree –
+The root of love lives on and on.
+Though branch by branch proved withered wood,
+The root is warm with precious wine.
+Then keep your faith, and leave me mine –
+All roads that lead to God are good.

+I. The husband's.
+She's not a faultless woman; no!
+She's not an angel in disguise:
+She has her rivals here below:
+She's not an unexampled prize:
+She does not always see the point
+Of little jests her husband makes:
+And, when the world is out of joint,
+She makes a hundred small mistakes:
+She's not a miracle of tact:
+Her temper's not the best I know:
+She's got her little faults in fact,
+Although I never tell her so.
+But this, my wife, is why I hold you
+As good a wife as ever stepped,
+And why I meant it when I told you
+How cordially our feast I kept:
+You've lived with me these fifty years,
+And all the time you loved me dearly:
+I may have given you cause for tears:
+I may have acted rather queerly.
+I ceased to love you long ago:
+I loved another for a season:
+As time went on I came to know
+Your worth, my wife: and saw the reason
+Why such a wife as you have been
+Is more than worth the world beside;
+You loved me all the time, my Queen;
+You couldn't help it if you tried.
+You loved me as I once loved you,
+As each loved each beside the altar:
+And whatsoever I might do,
+Your loyal heart could never falter.
+And, if you sometimes fail me, sweetest,
+And don't appreciate me, dear,
+No matter: such defects are meetest
+For poor humanity, I fear.
+And all's forgiven, all's forgot,
+On this our golden wedding day;
+For, see! she loves me: does she not?
+So let the world e'en go its way.
+I'm old and nearly useless now,
+Each day a greater weakling proves me:
+There's compensation anyhow:
+I still possess a wife that loves me.
+2. The wife's.
+Dear worthy husband! good old man!
+Fit hero of a golden marriage:
+I'll show towards you, if I can,
+And absolutely wifely carriage.
+The months or years which your career
+May still comprise before you perish,
+Shall serve to prove that I, my dear,
+Can honour, and obey, and cherish.
+Till death us part, as soon he must,
+(And you, my dear, should shew the way)
+I hope you'll always find me just
+The same as on our wedding day.
+I never loved you, dearest: never!
+Let that be clearly understood:
+I thought you good, and rather clever,
+And found you really rather good.
+And, what was more, I loved another,
+But couldn't get him: well, but, then
+You're just as bad, my erring brother,
+You most impeccable of men:--
+Except for this: my love was married
+Some weeks before I married you:
+While you, my amorous dawdler, tarried
+Till we'd been wed a year or two.
+You loved me at our wedding: I
+Loved some one else: and after that
+I never cast a loving eye
+On others: you -- well, tit for tat!
+But after all I made you cheerful:
+Your whims I've humoured: saw the point
+Of all your jokes: grew duly tearful,
+When you were sad, yet chose the joint
+You liked the best of all for dinner,
+And soothed you in your hours of woe:
+Although a miserable sinner,
+I am a good wife, as wives go.
+I bore with you and took your side,
+And kept my temper all the time:
+I never flirted; never cried,
+No ranked it as a heinous crime,
+When you preferred another lady,
+Or used improper words to me,
+Or told a story more than shady,
+Or snored and snorted after tea,
+Or otherwise gave proofs of being
+A dull and rather vain old man:
+I still succeeded in agreeing
+With all you said, (the safest plan),
+Yet always strove my point to carry,
+And make you do as I desired:
+I'm glad my people made me marry!
+They hit on just what I required.
+Had love been wanted - well, I couldn't
+Have given what I'd not to give;
+Or had a genius asked me! wouldn't
+The man have suffered? now, we live
+Among our estimable neighbours
+A decent and decorous life:
+I've earned by my protracted labours
+The title of a model wife.
+But when beneath the turf you're sleeping,
+And I'm sitting here in black,
+Engaged, as they'll suppose, in weeping,
+I shall not wish to have you back.
+3. The Vicar's.
+A good old couple! kind and wise!
+And oh! what love for one another!
+They've won, those two, life's highest prize,
+Oh! let us copy them, my brother.

+Above the lonely market dawn
+The sun begins to rise,
+And slowly makes its way into
+The glowing ember skies,
+Amidst the clouds of burning gold
+And scarlet which now pass,
+Across the heavens high above
+My sadness stays alas.
+And now I stand there all alone
+And watch the morning light,
+Creep over all the rooftops and
+Consume the dead of night,
+It shines upon the sleeping town
+Where calmness fills the air,
+And lights the dark and empty stalls
+With metal frames so bare.
+The pigeons rest on rooftops while
+The litter's strewn around,
+The remnants of the day before
+Lie restless on the ground,
+The paper cups and cans do roll
+Upon the breeze that blows,
+And come to rest against a wall
+Behind those empty rows.
+So still the rising morning now
+The shadows long and dark,
+The cold and empty marketplace
+Deserted and so stark,
+I walk alone with heavy heart
+Beyond the barren square,
+And look towards the church ahead
+Its loneliness I share.

+A bumblebee had hitched a ride
+by hanging on the starboard side
+of Russia's pride, the Aeroflot
+right near the engine where it's hot.
+The captain got her in the air,
+flew straight into the sun's hot glare.
+And then they climbed into the sky
+to heights where normal creatures die.
+The bumblebee had been a shade
+of gray and black, like gatorade.
+But soon, when covered with fine ice
+resembled modified white rice.
+The frost cut into his thin skin
+and quickly travelled further in.
+And once the plane reached  altitude
+the stowaway, still cold and nude
+pledged to his God that he would be,
+if saved, a better bumblebee.
+But God had heard this song before
+and did not trust them anymore,
+regardless of their place of birth
+or what their role was on this earth.
+They lied, all critters and their masters
+in peace and threatening disasters.
+Please save me, was the standard plea
+it was to be or not to be.
+But after God had done his deed
+they all returned to human need
+who  would forget their obligation
+and practice wanton fornication.
+The bumblebee who had good ears
+still hung there, though consumed by fears,
+when engine trouble hit the Boeing
+it was a question now of knowing
+what happens when they all just die.
+The bee then heard the pilot cry.
+And soon, the bird had to descend
+no power meant a bitter end.
+The bumblebee let go and flew
+right past (he saw the frantic crew) .
+With wings designed for tempered flight
+he soared, it really was a sight!
+But when he reached four hundred knots
+he heard, and felt the heat of shots,
+He saw them now, all hunting duck
+well, I'll be damned, they've gone amuck,
+they might just hit me in the head
+and I will surely be quite dead.
+His wings were burning from the speed
+the belly skin  began to bleed.
+So in an act of desperation
+he used some clever gravitation
+and grabbed a bullet, thirty-eight.
+It was in an ascending state
+and hit its target in the chest,
+right through the mallard's silver crest.
+Inside the heart it was quite pleasant,
+it smelled of duck, perhaps of pheasant.
+The bumblebee revived its blood
+and then they landed, with a thud.
+He stood, expelled by the contraction
+called ventricle ejection fraction.
+And as he stretched he heard a noise
+and then a hunter's frightened voice.
+The plane was now a fireball
+and passengers and crew, they all
+just perished in a blessed minute.
+'Thank  Destiny, I wasn't in it.'
+As you can see, this tale is odd.
+The bee, rejected by his God
+had found a friend in destiny
+and God had lost a bumblebee.

+They should not have left him there alone,
+Alone that is except for the cat.
+He was only nine, not old enough
+To be left alone in a basement flat,
+Alone, that is, except for the cat.
+A dog would have been a different thing,
+A big gruff dog with slashing jaws,
+But a cat with round eyes mad as gold,
+Plump as a cushion with tucked-in paws---
+Better have left him with a fair-sized rat!
+But what they did was leave him with a cat.
+He hated that cat; he watched it sit,
+A buzzing machine of soft black stuff,
+He sat and watched and he hated it,
+Snug in its fur, hot blood in a muff,
+And its mad gold stare and the way it sat
+Crooning dark warmth: he loathed all that.
+So he took Daddy's stick and he hit the cat.
+Then quick as a sudden crack in glass
+It hissed, black flash, to a hiding place
+In the dust and dark beneath the couch,
+And he followed the grin on his new-made face,
+A wide-eyed, frightened snarl of a grin,
+And he took the stick and he thrust it in,
+Hard and quick in the furry dark.
+The black fur squealed and he felt his skin
+Prickle with sparks of dry delight.
+Then the cat again came into sight,
+Shot for the door that wasn't quite shut,
+But the boy, quick too, slammed fast the door:
+The cat, half-through, was cracked like a nut
+And the soft black thud was dumped on the floor.
+Then the boy was suddenly terrified
+And he bit his knuckles and cried and cried;
+But he had to do something with the dead thing there.
+His eyes squeezed beads of salty prayer
+But the wound of fear gaped wide and raw;
+He dared not touch the thing with his hands
+So he fetched a spade and shovelled it
+And dumped the load of heavy fur
+In the spidery cupboard under the stair
+Where it's been for years, and though it died
+It's grown in that cupboard and its hot low purr
+Grows slowly louder year by year:
+There'll not be a corner for the boy to hide
+When the cupboard swells and all sides split
+And the huge black cat pads out of it.

+Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;

+Law of love?  Sounds good… so, tell me more…
+Love of law?  mmm…maybe…not so sure…
+You can disregard the ancients –
+label them  Not Applicable – bin that bulky file…
+or try to make some sense; and they insist
+that love and law are so close intertwined
+that together, they may tell
+more than each other taken individually.
+What might this mean? Where can we start?
+Those ancients say that all this universe,
+all this creation, is one single act of love;
+love brings it forth, sustains it, nourishes it,
+and so ultimately, it merges into love;
+and by the laws of love,
+which hold all forms by law,
+our natural state is naught but love;
+and knowing this, knows no injustice in ourself;
+knows all as equal; knows no pressures nor compulsions;
+knows no darkness; and no partiality or preferentiality;
+and partaking of this universal love,
+we’re therefore just, and light of heart,
+and ready of response..
+and so, this love, which knows ourself as love,
+(for every creature's nature is pure love)
+may love the laws which make our nature thus;
+love the laws of love, and live as love;
+so out of love, comes law;
+and out of law, comes love.
+only in this fleeting moment of the present
+is our life lived;
+and only if, in this continuous now,
+love and law are present in each action,
+may we make our golden future;
+live a golden life, where law has made us free.
+this, the ancients say; the proof is ours to live.

+Pale, at its ghastly noon,
+Pauses above the death-still wood--the moon;
+The night-sprite, sighing, through the dim air stirs;
+The clouds descend in rain;
+Mourning, the wan stars wane,
+Flickering like dying lamps in sepulchres!
+Haggard as spectres--vision-like and dumb,
+Dark with the pomp of death, and moving slow,
+Towards that sad lair the pale procession come
+Where the grave closes on the night below.
+With dim, deep-sunken eye,
+Crutched on his staff, who trembles tottering by?
+As wrung from out the shattered heart, one groan
+Breaks the deep hush alone!
+Crushed by the iron fate, he seems to gather
+All life's last strength to stagger to the bier,
+And hearken--Do these cold lips murmur "Father?"
+The sharp rain, drizzling through that place of fear,
+Pierces the bones gnawed fleshless by despair,
+And the heart's horror stirs the silver hair.
+Fresh bleed the fiery wounds
+Through all that agonizing heart undone--
+Still on the voiceless lips "my Father" sounds,
+And still the childless Father murmurs "Son!"
+Ice-cold--ice-cold, in that white shroud he lies--
+Thy sweet and golden dreams all vanished there--
+The sweet and golden name of "Father" dies
+Into thy curse,--ice-cold--ice-cold--he lies!
+Dead, what thy life's delight and Eden were!
+Mild, as when, fresh from the arms of Aurora,
+While the air like Elysium is smiling above,
+Steeped in rose-breathing odors, the darling of Flora
+Wantons over the blooms on his winglets of love.
+So gay, o'er the meads, went his footsteps in bliss,
+The silver wave mirrored the smile of his face;
+Delight, like a flame, kindled up at his kiss,
+And the heart of the maid was the prey of his chase.
+Boldly he sprang to the strife of the world,
+As a deer to the mountain-top carelessly springs;
+As an eagle whose plumes to the sun are unfurled,
+Swept his hope round the heaven on its limitless wings.
+Proud as a war-horse that chafes at the rein,
+That, kingly, exults in the storm of the brave;
+That throws to the wind the wild stream of its mane,
+Strode he forth by the prince and the slave!
+Life like a spring day, serene and divine,
+In the star of the morning went by as a trance;
+His murmurs he drowned in the gold of the wine,
+And his sorrows were borne on the wave of the dance.
+Worlds lay concealed in the hopes of his youth!--
+When once he shall ripen to manhood and fame!
+Fond father exult!--In the germs of his youth
+What harvests are destined for manhood and fame!
+Not to be was that manhood!--The death-bell is knelling,
+The hinge of the death-vault creaks harsh on the ears--
+How dismal, O Death, is the place of thy dwelling!
+Not to be was that manhood!--Flow on, bitter tears!
+Go, beloved, thy path to the sun,
+Rise, world upon world, with the perfect to rest;
+Go--quaff the delight which thy spirit has won,
+And escape from our grief in the Halls of the Blest.
+Again (in that thought what a healing is found!)
+To meet in the Eden to which thou art fled!--
+Hark, the coffin sinks down with a dull, sullen sound,
+And the ropes rattle over the sleep of the dead.
+And we cling to each other!--O Grave, he is thine!
+The eye tells the woe that is mute to the ears--
+And we dare to resent what we grudge to resign,
+Till the heart's sinful murmur is choked in its tears.
+Pale at its ghastly noon,
+Pauses above the death-still wood--the moon!
+The night-sprite, sighing, through the dim air stirs:
+The clouds descend in rain;
+Mourning, the wan stars wane,
+Flickering like dying lamps in sepulchres.
+The dull clods swell into the sullen mound;
+Earth, one look yet upon the prey we gave!
+The grave locks up the treasure it has found;
+Higher and higher swells the sullen mound--
+Never gives back the grave!

+Ah whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me?
+What wontless fury dost thou now inspire
+Into my feeble breast, too full of thee?
+Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,
+Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,
+And up aloft above my strength dost raise
+The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.
+That as I erst in praise of thine own name,
+So now in honour of thy mother dear,
+An honourable hymn I eke should frame,
+And with the brightness of her beauty clear,
+The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear
+To admiration of that heavenly light,
+From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.
+Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,
+Mother of love, and of all world's delight,
+Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty
+Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,
+Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light
+T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,
+And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:
+That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,
+And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam
+Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,
+That now it wasted is with woes extreme,
+It may so please, that she at length will stream
+Some dew of grace into my withered heart,
+After long sorrow and consuming smart.
+WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast
+To make all things such as we now behold,
+It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd
+A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould
+He fashion'd them as comely as he could;
+That now so fair and seemly they appear,
+As nought may be amended anywhere.
+That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,
+Whether in earth laid up in secret store,
+Or else in heaven, that no man may it see
+With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,
+Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;
+Whose face and feature doth so much excel
+All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.
+Thereof as every earthly thing partakes
+Or more or less, by influence divine,
+So it more fair accordingly it makes,
+And the gross matter of this earthly mine,
+Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,
+Doing away the dross which dims the light
+Of that fair beam which therein is empight.
+For, through infusion of celestial power,
+The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,
+And lifeful spirits privily doth pour
+Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight
+They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,
+O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam
+Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.
+That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace
+To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,
+Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,
+Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,
+And robs the hearts of those which it admire;
+Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,
+That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.
+How vainly then do idle wits invent,
+That beauty is nought else but mixture made
+Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament
+Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade
+And pass away, like to a summer's shade;
+Or that it is but comely composition
+Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.
+Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,
+That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,
+And therein stir such rage and restless stour,
+As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?
+Or can proportion of the outward part
+Move such affection in the inward mind,
+That it can rob both sense and reason blind?
+Why do not then the blossoms of the field,
+Which are array'd with much more orient hue,
+And to the sense most dainty odours yield,
+Work like impression in the looker's view?
+Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,
+In which oft-times we nature see of art
+Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?
+But ah, believe me, there is more than so,
+That works such wonders in the minds of men;
+I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,
+And whoso list the like assays to ken,
+Shall find by trial, and confess it then,
+That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,
+An outward shew of things, that only seem.
+For that same goodly hue of white and red,
+With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,
+And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread
+Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away
+To that they were, even to corrupted clay;
+That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,
+Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.
+But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray
+That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,
+Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;
+But when the vital spirits do expire,
+Unto her native planet shall retire;
+For it is heavenly born and cannot die,
+Being a parcel of the purest sky.
+For when the soul, the which derived was,
+At first, out of that great immortal Spright,
+By whom all live to love, whilom did pass
+Down from the top of purest heaven's height
+To be embodied here, it then took light
+And lively spirits from that fairest star,
+Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.
+Which power retaining still or more or less,
+When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,
+Through every part she doth the same impress,
+According as the heavens have her graced,
+And frames her house, in which she will be placed,
+Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil
+Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.
+Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have
+The most resemblance of that heavenly light,
+Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave
+Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,
+And the gross matter by a sovereign might
+Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen
+A palace fit for such a virgin queen.
+So every spirit, as it is most pure,
+And hath in it the more of heavenly light,
+So it the fairer body doth procure
+To habit in, and it more fairly dight
+With cheerful grace and amiable sight.
+For of the soul the body form doth take:
+For soul is form, and doth the body make.
+Therefore wherever that thou dost behold
+A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,
+Know this for certain, that the same doth hold
+A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,
+Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.
+For all that fair is, is by nature good;
+That is a sign to know the gentle blood.
+Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind
+Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,
+Either by chance, against the course of kind,
+Or through unaptness in the substance found,
+Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,
+That will not yield unto her form's direction,
+But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.
+And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)
+That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,
+Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,
+Which doth the world with her delight adorn,
+Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,
+Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,
+But every one doth seek but to deprave it.
+Yet nathëmore is that fair beauty's blame,
+But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:
+Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame
+May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:
+Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,
+However flesh{"e}s fault it filthy make;
+For things immortal no corruption take.
+But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments
+And lively images of heaven's light,
+Let not your beams with such disparagements
+Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;
+But mindful still of your first country's sight,
+Do still preserve your first informed grace,
+Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.
+Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,
+Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,
+That base affections, which your ears would bland,
+Commend to you by love's abused name,
+But is indeed the bondslave of defame;
+Which will the garland of your glory mar,
+And quench the light of your bright shining star.
+But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,
+Will more illumine your resplendent ray,
+And add more brightness to your goodly hue,
+From light of his pure fire; which, by like way
+Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;
+Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,
+Do both express the face's first impression.
+Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,
+It you behoves to love, and forth to lay
+That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,
+That men the more admire their fountain may;
+For else what booteth that celestial ray,
+If it in darkness be enshrined ever,
+That it of loving eyes be viewed never?
+But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,
+That likest to yourselves ye them select,
+The which your forms' first source may sympathize,
+And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;
+For, if you loosely love without respect,
+It is no love, but a discordant war,
+Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.
+For love is a celestial harmony
+Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,
+Which join together in sweet sympathy,
+To work each other's joy and true content,
+Which they have harbour'd since their first descent
+Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see
+And know each other here belov'd to be.
+Then wrong it were that any other twain
+Should in love's gentle band combined be
+But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,
+And made out of one mould the more t' agree;
+For all that like the beauty which they see,
+Straight do not love; for love is not so light
+As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.
+But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,
+With pure regard and spotless true intent,
+Drawing out of the object of their eyes
+A more refined form, which they present
+Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;
+Which it reducing to her first perfection,
+Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.
+And then conforming it unto the light,
+Which in itself it hath remaining still,
+Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,
+Thereof he fashions in his higher skill
+An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;
+And it embracing in his mind entire,
+The mirror of his own thought doth admire.
+Which seeing now so inly fair to be,
+As outward it appeareth to the eye,
+And with his spirit's proportion to agree,
+He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,
+And fully setteth his felicity;
+Counting it fairer than it is indeed,
+And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.
+For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be
+Than other men's, and in dear love's delight
+See more than any other eyes can see,
+Through mutual receipt of beam{"e}s bright,
+Which carry privy message to the spright,
+And to their eyes that inmost fair display,
+As plain as light discovers dawning day.
+Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,
+Armies of loves still flying to and fro,
+Which dart at them their little fiery lances;
+Whom having wounded, back again they go,
+Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;
+Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,
+Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.
+In which how many wonders do they rede
+To their conceit, that others never see,
+Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,
+Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;
+Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;
+But when her words' embássade forth she sends,
+Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.
+Sometimes upon her forehead they behold
+A thousand graces masking in delight;
+Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold
+Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight
+Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;
+But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,
+So many millions of chaste pleasures play.
+All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more
+Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,
+To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,
+That may it more to mortal eyes commend,
+And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:
+That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,
+And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.
+Then Iö, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,
+Advance the banner of thy conquest high,
+That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,
+May draw to thee, and with due fealty
+Adore the power of thy great majesty,
+Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,
+Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.
+In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,
+That she whose conquering beauty doth captive
+My trembling heart in her eternal chain,
+One drop of grace at length will to me give,
+That I her bounden thrall by her may live,
+And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,
+May owe to her, of whom I it received.
+And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,
+Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,
+When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,
+Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,
+That may recure my heart's long pining grief,
+And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,
+That can restore a damned wight from death.

+Accepting evil because God
+moves in a most mysterious way

+More likely is: He’s gone away
+and isn’t interested in us.
+That’s why we haven’t got a prayer,
+not even if we pray or fuss,

+than He appears: condoning evil
+would seem to be His major rule.
+Do not blame Him or blame the devil;

+Inspired by an article in The New Yorker by James Wood, “Holiday in Hellmouth: God may be dead, but the question why he permits suffering lives on” (June 9 and 16,2008) , discussing theodicy in general and Bart D. Ehrman’s “Accepting Jesus”:
+Theologians and philosophers talk about “the problem of evil, ” and the hygienic phrase itself bespeaks a certain distance from extreme suffering, the view from a life inside the charmed circle. They mean the classic difficulty of how we justify the existence of suffering and iniquity with belief in a God who created us, who loves us, and who providentially manages the world. The term for this justification is “theodicy, ” which nowadays seems a very old-fashioned exercise in turning around and around the stripped screw of theological scholastics. Still, if polls are correct, about eighty per cent of Americans ought to be engaged in such antiquarianism. Union University, in Jackson, Tennessee, might profit from intense classes in theodicy. “God protected this campus, ” one of the students there said, because no one was killed in the tornadoes that devastated parts of Tennessee on February 5th. Since ordinary Tennesseans were killed elsewhere that night, the logic of such shamanism is that God either did not or could not protect those unfortunates from something that the state’s governor once likened to “the wrath of God.”…
+Theodicy, or, rather, its failure, was the other major entry on my debit side. I was trapped within the age-old conundrum: the world is full of pain and wickedness; God may be jealous but is also merciful and all-loving (how much more so, if one believes that Christ incarnated him) . If he has the power to alleviate this suffering but does not, he is cruel; if he cannot, he is weak. I wasn’t consoled by the standard responses. Suffering is a mystery, I was told, as is God’s absence in the face of suffering. But this was what I was also told when prayers failed to make their mark: the old “incomprehensibility” routine. It seemed to me that the Gospels, central to my family life, made some fairly specific promises and laid on us some fairly specific obligations; yet that specificity could simply go on holiday whenever God himself seemed to have gone on holiday. (“God moves in mysterious ways.”)

+A letter from abroad. I tear
+Its sheathing open, unaware
+What treasure gleams within; and there-
+Like bird from cage-
+Flutters a curl of golden hair
+Out of the page.
+From such a frolic head 'twas shorn!
+('Tis but five years since he was born.)
+Not sunlight scampering over corn
+Were merrier thing.
+A child? A fragment of the morn,
+A piece of Spring!
+Surely an ampler, fuller day
+Than drapes our English skies with grey-
+A deeper light, a richer ray
+Than here we know-
+To this bright tress have given away
+Their living glow.
+For Willie dwells where gentian flowers
+Make mimic sky in mountain bowers;
+And vineyards steeped in ardent hours
+Slope to the wave
+Where storied Chillon's tragic towers
+Their bases lave;
+And over piny tracts of Vaud
+The rose of eve steals up the snow;
+And on the waters far below
+Strange sails like wings
+Half-bodilessly come and go,
+Fantastic things;
+And tender night falls like a sigh
+On
+châlet
+low and
+château
+high;
+And the far cataract's voice comes nigh,
+Where no man hears;
+And spectral peaks impale the sky
+On silver spears.
+Ah, Willie, whose dissevered tress
+Lies in my hand!-may you possess
+At least one sovereign happiness,
+Ev'n to your grave;
+One boon than which I ask naught less,
+Naught greater crave:
+May cloud and mountain, lake and vale,
+Never to you be trite or stale
+As unto souls whose wellsprings fail
+Or flow defiled,
+Till Nature's happiest fairy-tale
+Charms not her child!
+For when the spirit waxes numb,
+Alien and strange these shows become,
+And stricken with life's tedium
+The streams run dry,
+The choric spheres themselves are dumb,
+And dead the sky,-
+Dead as to captives grown supine,
+Chained to their task in sightless mine:
+Above, the bland day smiles benign,
+Birds carol free,
+In thunderous throes of life divine
+Leaps the glad sea;
+But they-their day and night are one.
+What is't to them, that rivulets run,
+Or what concern of theirs the sun?
+It seems as though
+Their business with these things was done
+Ages ago:
+Only, at times, each dulled heart feels
+That somewhere, sealed with hopeless seals,
+The unmeaning heaven about him reels,
+And he lies hurled
+Beyond the roar of all the wheels
+Of all the world.
+*
+On what strange track one's fancies fare!
+To eyeless night in sunless lair
+'Tis a far cry from Willie's hair;
+And here it lies-
+Human, yet something which can ne'er
+Grow sad and wise:
+Which, when the head where late it lay
+In life's grey dusk itself is grey,
+And when the curfew of life's day
+By death is tolled,
+Shall forfeit not the auroral ray
+And eastern gold.

+Meera was in the temple,
+Along with common people,
+Who also sang with her
+Closely following her.
+Her every divine song,
+All the rural folks sang.
+Thus these songs became
+Popular in course of time.
+Rana failed to bring her
+To the family life forever.
+His mother felt it a disgrace
+To the entire Rajputs race.
+His disgruntled widow-sister
+And hard hearted mother,
+Plotted against Meera then
+To kill her with cobra poison.
+A cup of milk with poison,
+They gave her one fine morn,
+In the temple, when she was
+Alone offering her prayers.
+It was poison, she knew well,
+But she drank the cup full.
+And continued her prayers.
+What a surprise it was!
+It didn’t act on Meera.
+But the face of Krishna
+At Dwaraka turned blue
+Suddenly with no clue.
+As an unexpected miracle,
+The doors of the temple,
+Both got themselves shut
+And stuck up too tight.
+As if nothing had happened,
+Before Krishna she remained.
+Her in-laws were desperate,
+As even poison didn’t act.
+Devotees from all corners
+Rushed there to see her,
+And the crowd was so thick
+It threw also some risk.
+Spies dressed like sadhus
+Studied the strategic points
+Thus weakening the position
+On the defensive front-line.
+One day two sadhus came
+And gave Meera that time
+A pearl chain as a gift
+Which she did accept.
+To Krishna she offered it,
+The one that was a gift,
+To the war-captive Allaudin,
+When he was given a pardon.
+Rana released him gracefully,
+On an agreement mutually,
+Offering him this chain,
+Just a gift, as a token.
+When the same chain
+To Rana was shown,
+He got terribly wild,
+That he was being spied.
+Immediately he ordered
+The temple be destroyed
+Which brought this crisis
+To the very palace doors.
+Devotees, not even a single,
+Came out of the temple.
+Even the elephants sent
+To break, back they all went.
+No damage could be done
+To the temple or anyone.
+For this incapable blame,
+Too wild Rana became.
+He sent cobras to bite her.
+They did no damage to her.
+As disgrace only she brought.
+She was a witch, he thought.
+Meera blamed only Krishna,
+For changing the mind of Rana,
+Who was so nice to her earlier
+But now bitterly hated her.

+SICK, Alice grown, and fearing dire event,
+Some friend advised a servant should be sent
+Her confessor to bring and ease her mind;--
+Yes, she replied, to see him I'm inclined;
+Let father Andrew instantly be sought:--
+By him salvation usually I'm taught.
+A MESSENGER was told, without delay,
+To take, with rapid steps, the convent way;
+He rang the bell--a monk enquired his name,
+And asked for what, or whom, the fellow came.
+I father Andrew want, the wight replied,
+Who's oft to Alice confessor and guide:
+With Andrew, cried the other, would you speak?
+If that's the case, he's far enough to seek;
+Poor man! he's left us for the regions blessed,
+And has in Paradise ten years confessed.

+A dream lies dead here. May you softly go
+Before this place, and turn away your eyes,
+Nor seek to know the look of that which dies
+Importuning Life for life. Walk not in woe,
+But, for a little, let your step be slow.
+And, of your mercy, be not sweetly wise
+With words of hope and Spring and tenderer skies.
+A dream lies dead; and this all mourners know:
+Whenever one drifted petal leaves the tree-
+Though white of bloom as it had been before
+And proudly waitful of fecundity-
+One little loveliness can be no more;
+And so must Beauty bow her imperfect head
+Because a dream has joined the wistful dead!

+Why did I go out last night?
+Maybe living alone,
+and being at home
+forced me to follow to you.
+Or the excuse of a meal,
+Every good deal,
+Is better once
+a beer or two
+Why did they find me at the bar?
+I was ready to leave,
+And then a reprieve
+“we’ve got plenty of beers up there”
+Why can’t I say,
+to my dismay,
+“work, and I must be aware”
+Why did I shotgun that beer?
+Wasn’t it enough,
+To drink and play rough
+And why race to find some cheer
+I’m not a quitter,
+I’m always a winner,
+And its easier to chug cold beer.
+Why did I hit on that girl?
+Couldn’t you see
+She was not free
+Her boyfriend made sure you did.
+Your too old to fight,
+Yet it happened last night,
+Thank God you cheap shot that kid.
+Why did I dance on the bar?
+Don’t you think
+That winning the pink
+Is more difficult than being a fool?
+I’m not quite sure
+But after staying alert
+A celebration was called for too.
+Why did I kiss a townie?
+You my young friend
+Aren’t as dumb as you pretend
+She’s twice your age atleast!
+Oh well I think,
+With each coming drink,
+More like a model
+less like a beast.
+Why did I stay at her house?
+And now you awake
+Her kids are a play
+One is already at school
+Two are in college
+Learning some knowledge
+While mom sits on top of you
+I’ve said this before
+I’ll say it some more
+Don’t ever go out of your way
+To stay out at night,
+And get into fights.
+And work,
+lets fake it today.

+I.
+THERE was a lady, who had early wed
+One whom she saw and lov'd in her bright youth,
+When life was yet untried--and when he said
+He, too, lov'd her, he spoke no more than truth;
+He lov'd as well as baser natures can,--
+But a mean heart and soul were in that man.
+II.
+And they dwelt happily, if happy be
+Not with harsh words to breed unnatural strife:
+The cold world's Argus-watching failed to see
+The flaw that dimm'd the lustre of their life;
+Save that he seem'd tyrannical, tho' gay,
+Restless and selfish in his love of sway.
+III.
+The calm of conscious power was not in him;
+But rather, struggling into broader light,
+The secret sense, they feel, however dim,
+Whose chance position gives a sort of right
+(As from the height of a prescriptive throne,)
+To govern natures nobler than their own.
+IV.
+And as her youth waned slowly on, there fell
+A nameless shadow on that lady's heart;
+And those she lov'd the best (and she lov'd well),
+Had of her confidence nor share, nor part;
+Her thoughts lay folded from Life's lessening light,
+Like the sweet flowers which close themselves at night.
+V.
+And men began to whisper evil things
+Against the honour of her wedded mate;
+That which had pass'd for youth's wild wanderings,
+Showed more suspicious in his settled state;
+Until at length,--he stood, at some chance game,
+Discover'd,--branded with a Cheater's name.
+VI.
+Out, and away he slunk, with felon air;
+Then, calling to him one who was his friend,
+Bid him to that unblemish'd wife repair
+And tell her what had chanced, and what the end;
+How they must leave the country of their birth,
+And hide,--in some more distant spot of earth.
+VII.
+It was a coward's thought: he could not bear
+Himself to be narrator of his shame;
+He that had trampled oft, now felt in fear
+Of her who still must keep his blighted name,--
+And shrank in fancy from that steadfast eye,
+The window to a soul so pure and high.
+VIII.
+She heard it. O'er her brow there pass'd a flush
+Of sunset red; and then so white a hue,
+So deadly pale, it seem'd as if no blush
+Through that transparent cheek should shine anew;
+As if the blood had frozen in that hour,
+And her check'd pulse for ever lost its power.
+IX.
+And twice and once did she essay to speak;
+And with a gesture almost of command,
+(Though in its motion it was deadly weak)
+She faintly lifted up her graceful hand:--
+But then her soul came back to her, strength woke,
+And with a low but even voice, she spoke:
+X.
+'Go! say to him who dream'd of other chance,
+That HERE none sit in judgment on his sin;
+That to his door the world's scorn may advance,
+And cloud his path, but doth not enter in.
+Here dwell his Own: to share, to soothe disgrace;'--
+Which having said, she cover'd up her face,
+XI.
+And, as he left her, sank in bitter prayer,--
+If prayer that may be term'd which comes to all,
+That sudden gushing of our vain despair,
+When none but God can hear or heed our call;
+And the wreck'd soul feels, in its helpless hour,
+Where only dwells full mercy with full power.
+XII.
+And he came home, a crush'd and humbled wretch;
+Whom when she saw, she but this comfort found,
+In her kind arms that shrinking form to catch,
+Which tenderly about his neck she wound,
+As in the first proud days of love and trust,
+E'er yet his reckless head was bow'd in dust!
+XIII.
+And they departed to a distant shore;
+But wheresoe'er they dwelt, however lone,
+Shame, like a marble statue at his door,
+Flung her 'thwart shadow o'er his threshold stone;
+Still darken'd all their daylight hours, and kept
+Cold watch above them even while they slept.
+XIV.
+And there was no more love between those two!
+It died not in the shock of that dark hour--
+Such shocks destroy not love, whose purple hue
+Fades rather, like some autumn-wither'd flower,
+Which day by day along the ruin'd walk
+We see--then miss it from the sapless stalk;
+XV.
+And, while it fadeth, oft with gentle hand
+Doth memory turn to life's dark journal-book;
+And, passing foul misdeeds, intently stand
+On its first page of glorious hope to look;
+Weeping she reads,--and, seeing all so fair,
+Pleads hard for what we are, by what we were!
+XVI.
+So through that hour love lived; and, though in part
+'Twas one of most unutterable pain,
+It had its sweetness too, and told her heart
+All she could do, and all she could sustain;
+The holy love of woman buoy'd her up,
+And God gave strength to drink the bitter cup.
+XVII.
+But when, as days crept on, she saw him still
+Less grateful than abash'd beneath her eye,
+And studying not how best to banish ill,
+But what he might conceal and what deny,
+Her soul revolted, and conceived a scorn,
+Sinful and harsh, although of virtue born.
+XVIII.
+And oft she pray'd, with earnestness and pain,
+That heaven would bid that proud contempt depart,
+And wept to find the prayer and effort vain,
+Though it was breathed in agony of heart--
+Vain as the murmur of 'Thy will be done,'
+Breathed by the death-bed of an only son!
+XIX.
+For when her children err'd (as children will)
+A sickening terror smote her heart with fears,
+And scarce she measured the degree of ill,
+Or made indulgence for their tender years;
+They were HIS children; and the chance of shame
+Kept watch for those who bore that father's name.
+XX.
+And, thinking thus, reproof would take a tone
+So strangely passionate, severe, and wild--
+So deeply alter'd,--so unlike her own,--
+It stung and terrified her startled child,
+Whose innate sense of justice seem'd to show
+Him over-chidden, being chidden so.
+XXI.
+And then a gush of mother's love would swell
+Her grieving heart,--and she would fondly press
+The young offending head she loved so well
+Close to her own, with many a soft caress,
+Whose reconciling sweetness all in vain
+Stopp'd her boy's tears, while her's ran down like rain.
+XXII.
+The world (which still pronounces from the show
+Of outward things) whisper'd and talk'd of this;
+Erring and obstinate, its crowds ne'er know
+How much in judging they may judge amiss,
+Or how much agony and broken peace
+May lie beneath the seeming of caprice!
+XXIII.
+But he, her husband (for he was not dull),
+Saw through these workings of a troubled mind,
+And, that her cup of sorrow might be full,
+He taunted her with words and looks unkind,
+Which with a patient bowing of the heart
+She took--like one resolved to do her part.
+XXIV.
+And years stole on (for years go by like days,
+Leaving but scatter'd hours to mark their course),
+And brightness faded from that lady's gaze,
+And her cheek hollow'd, and her step lost force,
+Till it was plain to even a careless eye
+That she was doom'd, before her time, to die.
+XXV.
+She died, as she had lived, her secret soul
+Shut from the sweet communion of true friends;
+Her words, though not her thoughts, she could control,
+And still with calm respect his name she blends:
+They all stood round her whom she call'd her Own,
+And saw her die--yet was that death-bed lone!
+XXVI.
+But in its darkest hour her thoughts were stirr'd,
+And something falter'd from her dying tongue,
+Mournful and tender--half pronounced, half heard--
+For which he was too base--his boys too young;
+So whatso'er the warning faintly given,
+It lay between her parting soul and Heaven.
+XXVII.
+He wept for her--ah! who would not have wept
+To see that worn face in its pallid shroud,
+Proving how much she suffer'd ere she slept
+At peace for ever! Violent and loud
+Was the outbreaking of his sudden grief,
+And, like all feelings in that heart, 'twas brief.
+XXVIII.
+And something strange pass'd o'er his soul instead,
+When thinking upon her whom he had lost,
+Almost like a relief that she was dead:--
+She, whose high nature scorn'd his fault the most,
+And show'd it least,--had vanish'd from the earth,
+And none could check his sin, or shame his mirth.
+XXIX.
+So he return'd to many an evil way,
+Like one who strays when guiding light is gone;
+And mid the profligate, miscall'd 'the gay,'
+Crept to a slippery place--his tale half known--
+Ill look'd on, yet endured--the useful tool
+Of every bolder knave, or richer fool.
+XXX.
+And his two sons in careless beauty grew,
+Like wild-flowers in his path: he mark'd them not,
+Nor reck'd he what they needed, learnt, or knew,
+Or what might be on earth their future lot;
+But they died young--which is a thought of rest!
+Unscorn'd, untempted, undefiled--so best.

+After that hot gospeller has levelled all but the churched sky,
+I wrote the tale by tallow of a city's death by fire;

+All day I walked abroad among the rubbled tales,
+Shocked at each wall that stood on the street like a liar;
+Loud was the bird-rocked sky, and all the clouds were bales
+Torn open by looting, and white, in spite of the fire.
+By the smoking sea, where Christ walked, I asked, why

+Rebuilding a love I thought was dead as nails,

+Look those two old hens look like pretty good friends.

+The ducks and geese are walking proud,
+and the monkeys are screeching out loud.
+Pay attention to our demands,
+We want love and gentle patting hands.
+We want to be fed on time each day
+and given attention while we play.
+We want you to protect our right to live.
+In turn we have much love to give.

+Peace fills the air as she rolls on her back
+She got through it, She is alive and she thanks Him for that!
+It may loom in the mind of her loved ones today
+but soon it will vanish all signs of illness will fade.
+Don't focus on it...for there is solace in Peace.
+There is vision in health and hope moves her feet!
+Then when she feels better and she starts to dream...
+anticipation will fill her heart and Life will get Sweet.
+For in the years to come She will begin to persist...

+There is happiness in visions that will make her fluid,
+that makes her pliable, ready to change and just do it.

+Does one need more than a few square feet?
+Do we ever think or reflect?
+How much space we require when we die,

+Just a bare strip of earth!
+Yet, we forget this fact,
+We continue in our material pursuits,
+Ever greedy and avaricious,

+SWAMI VIVEKANANDA (A brief introduction)
+Swami Vivekananda (Narendranath Datta)    was born on 12-01-1863 at Kolkata and died on 04-07-1902 at 39 years of age.  He was a disciple of Guru Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who worshiped Mother Kali. Swamiji was the first religious ambassador to America, in which land he was recognized for his talents and deep knowledge in the Hindu ancient scriptures and religion.  He was advocating for Universal Religion.  Every world citizen should read his speeches in 9 Volumes released by the Ramakrishna Mission Association..   His life story starts with the Birth of Hinduism.
+THE BIRTH OF HINDUISM
+When did Hinduism begin?
+Still, the exact date is unknown.
+It’s such an ancient religion,
+Grown on a solid foundation.
+It’s a religion of tolerance,
+And with all its patience,
+It respects other religions,
+For their religious doctrines.
+In Bhagavad-gita Krishna says
+“There may be many ways,
+But all the paths lead to me,
+Whatever path it may be.”
+Religion is the backbone
+Of national life of Indian,
+And was nurtured by Great Sages
+From time immemorial, of all ages.
+At every time of spiritual crisis,
+In this Indian soil, there arose
+An Ascetic, a Sage, or a Saint,
+From the danger, to protect it.
+Rama, Krishna, Buddha,
+Adi Sankara, Nanak, Chaitanya,
+Like this, came messengers, one by one,
+All of them sent by the Heaven.
+Names many, there may be,
+But the Hindus ever see
+God as one Supreme,
+Not many, but as same.
+A man is not only a father,
+But also a son to his father,
+A teacher, when he teaches,
+A customer, when he buys.
+He’s a seller, when he sells.
+A preacher, when he tells.
+When he sails, he’s a sailor.
+When he stitches, he’s a tailor.
+As a King, he’s a ruler,
+As a mendicant, a beggar,
+When he wins, a winner,
+When he sins, a sinner.
+This one man, who’s the same
+Takes up many karmic names,
+Thus, Gods many have come
+But they’re one and the same.
+Brahma is the creator,
+Vishnu is the protector,
+Siva is the destroyer,
+*Karmic names, they bear.
+(*Karmic = action)
+Just like one Sun reflects,
+And shines in all reflectors,
+God is one, but projects,
+All o’er, as various objects.
+A compendium of Truths,
+The Hinduism gave as Vedas,
+Which lead one to the goal,
+That is sacred and spiritual.
+This is the salient truth
+That exists from its birth,
+Which had no beginning,
+Nor will it have an ending.

+Flute music is coming when I am writing this poem;

+Flute music reminds all of the hero of Bhagavad-Gita
+Who proposed the policy of nonattachment in life!
+Marriages are fixed in heaven many say since long time
+But why are some going for divorces after the marriage?
+Love or arranged marriages should be based on love;
+But too much attachment finding faults ends in divorces!
+Nothing is perfect in the world let alone love and marriage;
+What is more important is love to be cherished as humans
+So that relations would last longer making happier life here;
+Critically seeing differences one cannot find peace of mind.
+Bond of marriages is supposed to last till the end of life
+But not to suffer by marriages till the end of life in the world!

+Adieu, Paris, ville de fer,
+Ville de vent, ville de rêve,
+Cher Paris où l’amour se lève,
+Doux Paris où j’ai tant souffert !
+Et le train file, file, file,
+Comme un éclair en pleine nuit…
+Mon cœur fait encor plus de bruit,
+Mon cœur qui n’est jamais tranquille.
+Voici, sous la lune de mai,
+La plaine qu’on dit pittoresque,
+La verte combe où j’ai ri presque,
+La colline où j’ai presque aimé.
+L’histoire est-elle vraie ou fausse ?
+Suis-je un bon, un mauvais témoin ?
+Qu’importe ? – Voici déjà loin
+Les mornes plaines de la Beauce.
+Puis rien. – Du noir, du noir partout,
+Noir dans le ciel et sur la terre,
+Noir surtout au cœur solitaire,
+Gonflé de rage et de dégoût.
+Et le train file et le train vole
+Avec ses gros yeux qui font peur,
+Le train file à toute vapeur
+Comme une bête à moitié folle.
+Un vent mauvais semble frémir
+Dans les verdures qu’on effleure ;
+J’entends comme une âme qui pleure…
+Mon Dieu ! si je pouvais dormir ?
+Toujours, toujours, toujours la bête
+Aux crocs baveux, aux flancs repus !
+Toujours ces mots interrompus
+Qui s’entrechoquent dans ma tête !
+Les lourds pays indifférents
+Montrent un coin de leur visage ;
+La tristesse du paysage
+Répond à mes rêves errants.
+– Mais qu’est-ce ? – On dirait de la joie.
+Tout n’ait donc pas mort encor.
+Un trait rose, une barre d’or,
+Et l’infini rit et flamboie.
+Ce bleu tendre, ce bleu divin !
+Qu’ai-je vu ? C’est la mer immense
+Où tout finit et recommence,
+Que nul jamais n’invoque en vain.
+O consolatrice du monde !
+Puissante mer, ô grande mer !
+Si j’ai quelque chose d’amer,
+Qu’il se noie en ton eau profonde !
+Dame de sange et de langueur,
+Ensorceleuse de la brume,
+Ce n’est que dans ton amertume
+Que je pourrai laver mon cœur !

+Within themselves, they hold
+more than any man or woman should be asked to hold;
+they are the unsung heroes of the peace
+which clutches at the coat-tails of a war;
+and we can never truly know them;
+only offer them love, support, respect…
+My first school had been an officers’ recuperation hospital
+or final hospice for the wounded – in their body or their mind -
+in the 1914-18 war; now
+the dignified head doctor of few words
+and his beautifully-mannered, voluptuous
+ex-head-nurse wife
+had made of it an ideal, loving school
+for the new children of a new era after
+‘the war to end all wars’…
+The last resting place of warriors with screaming silent minds
+who could not recuperate or
+who found death so much more peaceful than their life
+became, first the art room,
+then the chapel: death, art, God and life
+all together in one room.
+My second school had as its teaching staff
+several ex-officers who had chosen to shroud their memories
+in teaching that new generation; but ironically,
+were asked to run the cadet force which was
+intended to preserve that lovely peace..
+the sergeant-major who taught us PT and defensive war
+had a face that was a repulsive souvenir –
+like camouflage – brown, red, livid white,
+almost the yellow-green of mustard gas
+that had painted war upon him;
+though he saved his lungs…
+fine, stern, stiff-upper-lip teachers
+shrouding their memories, until
+some pupil tested them too far –
+then their anger spilled, their canes and swagger-sticks
+fiercely wielded, were memories for those (not us)    who knew,
+of discipline that might shoot at dawn
+for the sake of lives then saved at dusk…
+today, they’d be hauled into court for passing on 'abuse';
+we were taught by heroes.
+My third school gave me a housemaster,
+another unsung, unsinging hero, a confirmed bachelor
+so we thought, who likewise buried unknown memories
+in devoted teaching; few clues except
+the same occasional, devastating temper when aroused;
+in his modest study, a few small
+muzzy photos in silver frames, of comrades – dead or alive?
+or did it matter? In his late fifties or even early sixties,
+some inner torment of his memories transcended,
+he surprised us all by marrying happily and producing
+a large family. And once again, we had little clue
+about the war he fought; or whether the nights
+brought him tormented dreams…
+We were taught by heroes who were asked to hold
+more than any man or woman should be asked to hold:
+do we wish – or should we wish –
+that we knew then what we guess now?
+They, teaching us from all their memories of hideous war,
+how to grow up in peace; only to see
+a generation of those same boys and girls
+demanded by another war..
+Autumn again; brown leaves fall like green lives;
+soon, November mists and poppies
+red as blood, red as children’s blood
+from a terrible union, of heroism and futility
+called war.

+And where is that poem I sensed in sleep?
+It may be caught within a swirling wind and
+cannot come to rest, or trapped in the crevice
+where two huge boulders lean and cannot break
+free, or it may need its deep sleep, stretched out
+on dry grass. The poem has its own life, it certainly
+knows the hour of its birth, and will arrive
+propelled by rhythms of mind and nature in tandem.
+Its impulse is always toward revelation.
+I wonder what impulse drives me: Do I walk
+these grasslands and climb these hills to provoke
+the poems whose writing is my familiar fulfillment?
+Or do I write poems to justify my ceaseless walking
+to no discernible goal? Will it matter if I find
+today's poem barely floating on the green slime
+of a stagnant pond? Will it be improved if I find it
+crowned with solar glory on the high ledge
+above a river valley? The poem will ever be
+the middle ground between Nature and myself.
+And so all things occur in their immediate motions -
+grasses, hills, sunlight, my self, the animals,
+the unwritten poems, plants and flowers and
+the life-pregnant soil, the waters and the swirling air.
+All fold together despite their strangeness,
+their separateness. And I, the poet of this moment,
+imagine how a natural love makes them familiars,
+and dream it can last for evermore...
+Oh, blessed persuasion! The poem is even now
+within my ken! I can be quiet now. It comes apace!

+Cord.                      First, it does freely flye
+Into the pleasures of a lover's eye;
+But, once condemn'd to scorn, it fetter'd lies,

+Amor.     I pity its sad fate, since its offence
+Was but for love.  Can tears recall it thence?
+Cord.     O no, such tears, as do for pity call,
+She proudly scorns, and glories at their fall.
+Amor.     Since neither sighs nor tears, kind shepherd, tell,
+Will not a kiss prevail?
+Cord.                           Thou may'st as well
+Court Eccho with a kiss.
+Amor.                           Can no art move

+Amor.     Then, captive heart, since that no humane spell
+Hath power to graspe thee his, farewell.
+Cord. Farewell.

+the power of God is truly amazing, he never dissapoints us.  Even when we think he may have forgotten us, he shows his hand and the glory of his love.
+I had many family issues in the last few weeks and just couldn't take it anymore so I did what I consider to be the obvious.  I gave all my troubles to God and left them in his hands, my daughter did the same.
+I decided to write a prayer letting Satan know he doesn't scare me and at the end of that prayer when I dotted the last period, I heard someone at the door and there was my long lost son.
+Earlier in the day, everyone said when they finally see my son again they would hit him, give him a piece of their mind.  All I could do when I laid eyes on him was hug him and let him know how much I loved him.
+After giving my troubles over to the Lord, my daughter and I, everything seemed to immediatlely turn around.  I just want to thankyou Jesus.

+The spittled eyes, the salt ponds in the sleeves,

+In the snivelling hours with dead, humped Ann
+Whose hodded, fountain heart once fell in puddles
+Round the parched worlds of Wales and drowned each sun
+(Though this for her is a monstrous image blindly
+Magnified out of praise; her death was a still drop;
+She would not have me sinking in the holy
+Flood of her heart's fame; she would lie dumb and deep

+But I, Ann's bard on a raised hearth, call all

+Babble like a bellbuoy over the hymning heads,
+Bow down the walls of the ferned and foxy woods
+That her love sing and swing through a brown chapel,

+Is carved from her in a room with a wet window
+In a fiercely mourning house in a crooked year.
+I know her scrubbed and sour humble hands
+Lie with religion in their cramp, her threadbare
+Whisper in a damp word, her wits drilled hollow,
+Her fist of a face died clenched on a round pain;
+And sculptured Ann is seventy years of stone.
+These cloud-sopped, marble hands, this monumental
+Argument of the hewn voice, gesture and psalm
+Storm me forever over her grave until
+The stuffed lung of the fox twitch and cry Love
+And the strutting fern lay seeds on the black sill.

+Memorial Day weekend, ESPN, I watched, “Outside The Lines, ”
+And what I heard, well as the saying goes it just, “blew my mind, ”
+High school kids desiring to advance & arrive at the college level,
+However, there are those coaches who would bury it with a shovel.
+7-on-7 football program is rapidly gaining popularity nationwide,
+Okay now begs the question, what right has the NCAA to decide?
+Former NFL great, Keyshawn Johnson sponsors & coaches teens,
+By the way he doesn’t make any money but spends his own green.
+How is it that people are in a huff about a day spent on a yacht?
+To reward the kids for their efforts and enjoy what they have not?
+Giving a sneak peak at what can be accomplished and the reward,
+Should they reach the pinnacle of success and are able to afford.
+Two Caucasian coaches speaking on OTL were one 100% against,
+And should be obvious they grew up on the other side of the fence,
+Whereas the majority of these teens are of African American decent,
+Now with the high unemployment rate parents are just making rent.
+How dare they or anybody come on camera, whine, moan & groan,
+Because most of these kids will never qualify for any student loans,
+Until they or anyone are willing to foot the bill, leave them alone,
+Prejudice is not manifested in the locker room it begins at home.
+Scholarships are the one and only way they will ever continue on,
+How can any sanctioning body not involved declare it is wrong?
+When a former standout wide receiver is willing to share his time,
+What gives those who’ve never played a right to speak their mind?
+It’s impossible to appreciate endless opportunities unless exposed,
+As inner city Blacks, Hispanics & Whites the whole world knows,
+Are like goldfish in their limited environment of one gallon bowls,
+Till the big fish on the outside take time to tutor & help them grow.
+So, when coaches steer them towards colleges they graduated from,
+Would that not be better than not being recruited from a single one?
+Or a school with unscrupulous characteristics and deceitful means?
+No one alive has the right to prematurely squash God given dreams.

+When that rich soul which to her heaven is gone,
+Whom all do celebrate, who know they have one
+(For who is sure he hath a soul, unless
+It see, and judge, and follow worthiness,
+And by deeds praise it? He who doth not this,
+May lodge an inmate soul, but 'tis not his)
+When that queen ended here her progress time,
+And, as t'her standing house, to heaven did climb,
+Where loath to make the saints attend her long,
+She's now a part both of the choir, and song;
+This world, in that great earthquake languished;
+For in a common bath of tears it bled,
+Which drew the strongest vital spirits out;
+But succour'd then with a perplexed doubt,
+Whether the world did lose, or gain in this,
+(Because since now no other way there is,
+But goodness, to see her, whom all would see,
+All must endeavour to be good as she)
+This great consumption to a fever turn'd,
+And so the world had fits; it joy'd, it mourn'd;
+And, as men think, that agues physic are,
+And th' ague being spent, give over care,
+So thou, sick world, mistak'st thy self to be
+Well, when alas, thou'rt in a lethargy.
+Her death did wound and tame thee then, and then
+Thou might'st have better spar'd the sun, or man.
+That wound was deep, but 'tis more misery
+That thou hast lost thy sense and memory.
+'Twas heavy then to hear thy voice of moan,
+But this is worse, that thou art speechless grown.
+Thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst; thou wast
+Nothing but she, and her thou hast o'erpast.
+For, as a child kept from the font until
+A prince, expected long, come to fulfill
+The ceremonies, thou unnam'd had'st laid,
+Had not her coming, thee her palace made;
+Her name defin'd thee, gave thee form, and frame,
+And thou forget'st to celebrate thy name.
+Some months she hath been dead (but being dead,
+Measures of times are all determined)
+But long she'ath been away, long, long, yet none
+Offers to tell us who it is that's gone.
+But as in states doubtful of future heirs,
+When sickness without remedy impairs
+The present prince, they're loath it should be said,
+'The prince doth languish,' or 'The prince is dead;'
+So mankind feeling now a general thaw,
+A strong example gone, equal to law,
+The cement which did faithfully compact
+And glue all virtues, now resolv'd, and slack'd,
+Thought it some blasphemy to say sh'was dead,
+Or that our weakness was discovered
+In that confession; therefore spoke no more
+Than tongues, the soul being gone, the loss deplore.
+But though it be too late to succour thee,
+Sick world, yea dead, yea putrified, since she
+Thy' intrinsic balm, and thy preservative,
+Can never be renew'd, thou never live,
+I (since no man can make thee live) will try,
+What we may gain by thy anatomy.
+Her death hath taught us dearly that thou art
+Corrupt and mortal in thy purest part.
+Let no man say, the world itself being dead,
+'Tis labour lost to have discovered
+The world's infirmities, since there is none
+Alive to study this dissection;
+For there's a kind of world remaining still,
+Though she which did inanimate and fill
+The world, be gone, yet in this last long night,
+Her ghost doth walk; that is a glimmering light,
+A faint weak love of virtue, and of good,
+Reflects from her on them which understood
+Her worth; and though she have shut in all day,
+The twilight of her memory doth stay,
+Which, from the carcass of the old world free,
+Creates a new world, and new creatures be
+Produc'd. The matter and the stuff of this,
+Her virtue, and the form our practice is.
+And though to be thus elemented, arm
+These creatures from home-born intrinsic harm,
+(For all assum'd unto this dignity
+So many weedless paradises be,
+Which of themselves produce no venomous sin,
+Except some foreign serpent bring it in)
+Yet, because outward storms the strongest break,
+And strength itself by confidence grows weak,
+This new world may be safer, being told
+The dangers and diseases of the old;
+For with due temper men do then forgo,
+Or covet things, when they their true worth know.
+There is no health; physicians say that we
+At best enjoy but a neutrality.
+And can there be worse sickness than to know
+That we are never well, nor can be so?
+We are born ruinous: poor mothers cry
+That children come not right, nor orderly;
+Except they headlong come and fall upon
+An ominous precipitation.
+How witty's ruin! how importunate
+Upon mankind! It labour'd to frustrate
+Even God's purpose; and made woman, sent
+For man's relief, cause of his languishment.
+They were to good ends, and they are so still,
+But accessory, and principal in ill,
+For that first marriage was our funeral;
+One woman at one blow, then kill'd us all,
+And singly, one by one, they kill us now.
+We do delightfully our selves allow
+To that consumption; and profusely blind,
+We kill our selves to propagate our kind.
+And yet we do not that; we are not men;
+There is not now that mankind, which was then,
+When as the sun and man did seem to strive,
+(Joint tenants of the world) who should survive;
+When stag, and raven, and the long-liv'd tree,
+Compar'd with man, died in minority;
+When, if a slow-pac'd star had stol'n away
+From the observer's marking, he might stay
+Two or three hundred years to see't again,
+And then make up his observation plain;
+When, as the age was long, the size was great
+(Man's growth confess'd, and recompens'd the meat),
+So spacious and large, that every soul
+Did a fair kingdom, and large realm control;
+And when the very stature, thus erect,
+Did that soul a good way towards heaven direct.
+Where is this mankind now? Who lives to age,
+Fit to be made Methusalem his page?
+Alas, we scarce live long enough to try
+Whether a true-made clock run right, or lie.
+Old grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow,
+And for our children we reserve tomorrow.
+So short is life, that every peasant strives,
+In a torn house, or field, to have three lives.
+And as in lasting, so in length is man
+Contracted to an inch, who was a span;
+For had a man at first in forests stray'd,
+Or shipwrack'd in the sea, one would have laid
+A wager, that an elephant, or whale,
+That met him, would not hastily assail
+A thing so equall to him; now alas,
+The fairies, and the pigmies well may pass
+As credible; mankind decays so soon,
+We'are scarce our fathers' shadows cast at noon,
+Only death adds t'our length: nor are we grown
+In stature to be men, till we are none.
+But this were light, did our less volume hold
+All the old text; or had we chang'd to gold
+Their silver; or dispos'd into less glass
+Spirits of virtue, which then scatter'd was.
+But 'tis not so; w'are not retir'd, but damp'd;
+And as our bodies, so our minds are cramp'd;
+'Tis shrinking, not close weaving, that hath thus
+In mind and body both bedwarfed us.
+We seem ambitious, God's whole work t'undo;
+Of nothing he made us, and we strive too,
+To bring our selves to nothing back; and we
+Do what we can, to do't so soon as he.
+With new diseases on our selves we war,
+And with new physic, a worse engine far.
+Thus man, this world's vice-emperor, in whom
+All faculties, all graces are at home
+(And if in other creatures they appear,
+They're but man's ministers and legates there
+To work on their rebellions, and reduce
+Them to civility, and to man's use);
+This man, whom God did woo, and loath t'attend
+Till man came up, did down to man descend,
+This man, so great, that all that is, is his,
+O what a trifle, and poor thing he is!
+If man were anything, he's nothing now;
+Help, or at least some time to waste, allow
+T'his other wants, yet when he did depart
+With her whom we lament, he lost his heart.
+She, of whom th'ancients seem'd to prophesy,
+When they call'd virtues by the name of she;
+She in whom virtue was so much refin'd,
+That for alloy unto so pure a mind
+She took the weaker sex; she that could drive
+The poisonous tincture, and the stain of Eve,
+Out of her thoughts, and deeds, and purify
+All, by a true religious alchemy,
+She, she is dead; she's dead: when thou knowest this,
+Thou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is,
+And learn'st thus much by our anatomy,
+The heart being perish'd, no part can be free,
+And that except thou feed (not banquet) on
+The supernatural food, religion,
+Thy better growth grows withered, and scant;
+Be more than man, or thou'rt less than an ant.
+Then, as mankind, so is the world's whole frame
+Quite out of joint, almost created lame,
+For, before God had made up all the rest,
+Corruption ent'red, and deprav'd the best;
+It seiz'd the angels, and then first of all
+The world did in her cradle take a fall,
+And turn'd her brains, and took a general maim,
+Wronging each joint of th'universal frame.
+The noblest part, man, felt it first; and then
+Both beasts and plants, curs'd in the curse of man.
+So did the world from the first hour decay,
+That evening was beginning of the day,
+And now the springs and summers which we see,
+Like sons of women after fifty be.
+And new philosophy calls all in doubt,
+The element of fire is quite put out,
+The sun is lost, and th'earth, and no man's wit
+Can well direct him where to look for it.
+And freely men confess that this world's spent,
+When in the planets and the firmament
+They seek so many new; they see that this
+Is crumbled out again to his atomies.
+'Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone,
+All just supply, and all relation;
+Prince, subject, father, son, are things forgot,
+For every man alone thinks he hath got
+To be a phoenix, and that then can be
+None of that kind, of which he is, but he.
+This is the world's condition now, and now
+She that should all parts to reunion bow,
+She that had all magnetic force alone,
+To draw, and fasten sund'red parts in one;
+She whom wise nature had invented then
+When she observ'd that every sort of men
+Did in their voyage in this world's sea stray,
+And needed a new compass for their way;
+She that was best and first original
+Of all fair copies, and the general
+Steward to fate; she whose rich eyes and breast
+Gilt the West Indies, and perfum'd the East;
+Whose having breath'd in this world, did bestow
+Spice on those Isles, and bade them still smell so,
+And that rich India which doth gold inter,
+Is but as single money, coin'd from her;
+She to whom this world must it self refer,
+As suburbs or the microcosm of her,
+She, she is dead; she's dead: when thou know'st this,
+Thou know'st how lame a cripple this world is

+And scornful of too much sweetness,
+But full of tang and flavor
+And better than bread to the hungry.
+O wild winds, and clumsy, pilfering bees,
+With the whole world to be wanton in,
+Will you not spare my little tea-rose?
+And O ruthless blind creatures,
+Who lay eggs of evil at the core of life,
+Pass by my one red apple,
+That is so firm and sound!

+14/11. Paris
+14/11 another fine day in Portugal to wake up for but the news
+from Paris turned the sky grey and the sun a spent cartridge
+cooling in the body of a man in a café, beer, wine and blood.
+Allah Akbar, god the great and merciful, what a horrible irony
+in the streets of deaths.
+I walked in the sunlight that unashamedly shone on a day of dread
+and it warmed my cold face and somewhere in Paris a man sits
+outside and plays “Imagine” on a piano it is heart -breaking and I`m
+filled with conflicting feeling anger and trying to understand what
+is impossible to grasp.
+I fear the backlash and the fascist demagogues who can use the shock
+to their political goal and they will be believed by an incensed mob,
+Arabs will be killed for belonging to Semitic tribe that have suffered
+unbelievable bad luck that never seems to end.

+All Things will indeed fall in place, for our God is a God of Grace.
+All fears God will erase away, giving you comfort along the way.
+Replacing the fear He does erase, with God’s peace in its place.
+Soon what seems so very new, will all be common place for you.
+The Grace God bestows on you, in His time will see you through.
+No matter what your heart may say, God will lead you all the way.
+As your emotion wells up inside, in Christ Jesus you must abide.
+For His Grace is sufficient friend, from the beginning to the end.
+What seems today to be concern, is just one more means to learn.
+God will help you to understand, the present task you have at hand.
+God puts you on unknown roads, sometimes with very heavy loads.
+God uses things you don’t know, within your world to help you grow.
+He works out tasks big and small; and God helps you when you fall.
+What seems to be a huge task, can shrink to nothing when you ask.
+Going to God on bended knees, will put your troubled heart at ease.
+Just ask God right where you are, for Christ, my friend, is never far.
+Friend, any time, any place, you can call upon His Awesome Grace.
+A Grace that reaches far and wide, filling you with His Peace inside.
+Just let Christ Jesus fill your heart, in each and every task you start.

+This bloody poetry writing - it's like rock-climbing -
+who asked you to, anyway?
+who needs it?
+why can't you be just like everyone else -
+admire the mountain from afar,
+Olympus, Parnassus, whatever, what's in a  name?
+its cap of snow, the way you often can't see the top
+for mist; like romance around truth.
+Homer at the top saw gods - shall you?
+But no -
+it's a fine summer morning
+and you get the urge to see the view from the top;
+well fine, but that's not enough for you,
+no going up the standard route for you, oh no,
+you want to be the first to get to the top by
+a new route never attempted before...
+so there you are an hour or two later, at the grassy foot
+safe in your skin and about to risk your life
+(and your reputation, you conceited little man)
+and off we go...
+the rockface, truth itself (and did you give a single thought
+to how that was built, or who might have built it?)
+and you with this tiny, hot ambition;
+but take it calmly now, word by word, or you're in trouble
+and it's a banal climbdown for anyone to see and read.
+and it's not as if anyone is going to appreciate
+the difficulty of your climb
+without doing it themself; and taste the exhilaration,
+the selfish, lonely, glorious exhilaration
+as you gain the top, and gaze at the heart-stirring, breeze-blessed view
+as if you are for those few minutes before other thoughts creep in,
+the master of your universe...
+but beware, even the climb down you now face
+back to the plains of everyday
+may be a sterner test - humility may even
+cross your mind, as you recall each step
+that that same rockface of the truth
+that challenged all your skills to master,
+saved your life every step,  by its every ancient crack and crevice
+so conveniently provided by nature and those millions upon millions
+of seashells that built this truthful mountain...
+and now, you're back on the level plain of everyday -
+are you going to keep it quiet, or tell the world?
+'Look, there's the mountain I climbed! ' 'Yes, I saw it
+in the paper - how's the wife? ' And though
+it'll be recorded in the books, the later editions will point out
+that yes it was the first, but that was before the first
+girl did it by that route, the first child,
+the first man did it barefoot,
+the first blind man did it from memory...
+yes you'll feel good, yes you'll feel a bigger man,
+yes you'll be a better climber for it,
+yes your fellow climbers
+will treat your name with respect,
+yes they'll read it in the books,
+but they'll never know, unless they try it,
+how it felt at every risky step,
+the holds you didn't take for caution's sake
+on that rockface of truth,
+what went through your mind or got blotted out.
+But you'll know. And that's enough for you.
+Personal satisfaction. And the hope
+that your book about it will touch others,
+even sell well. Your heart's in it -
+what more can you ask?
+This bloody poetry-writing.

+A bullet on a mission with the sound of scorn

+And then, a nightingale, sits on the knotted branch

+and sings the sweetest song that Nature could conceive
+she sings for me and tells about my distant love.
+It is enough to hear the sounds of this fine music

+This life is a hospital where every patient is possessed with the desire to change beds; one man would like to
+suffer in front of the stove, and another believes that he would recover his health beside the window.
+It always seems to me that I should feel well in the place where I am not, and this question of removal is one
+which I discuss incessantly with my soul.
+'Tell me, my soul, poor chilled soul, what do you think of going to live in Lisbon? It must be warm there, and there
+you would invigorate yourself like a lizard. This city is on the sea-shore; they say that it is built of marble
+and that the people there have such a hatred of vegetation that they uproot all the trees. There you have a landscape
+that corresponds to your taste! a landscape made of light and mineral, and liquid to reflect them!'
+My soul does not reply.
+'Since you are so fond of stillness, coupled with the show of movement, would you like to settle in Holland,
+that beatifying country? Perhaps you would find some diversion in that land whose image you have so often admired
+in the art galleries. What do you think of Rotterdam, you who love forests of masts, and ships moored at the foot of
+houses?'
+My soul remains silent.
+'Perhaps Batavia attracts you more? There we should find, amongst other things, the spirit of Europe
+married to tropical beauty.'
+Not a word. Could my soul be dead?
+'Is it then that you have reached such a degree of lethargy that you acquiesce in your sickness? If so, let us
+flee to lands that are analogues of death. I see how it is, poor soul! We shall pack our trunks for Tornio. Let us go
+farther still to the extreme end of the Baltic; or farther still from life, if that is possible; let us settle at the Pole. There
+the sun only grazes the earth obliquely, and the slow alternation of light and darkness suppresses variety and
+increases monotony, that half-nothingness. There we shall be able to take long baths of darkness, while for our
+amusement the aurora borealis shall send us its rose-coloured rays that are like the reflection of Hell's own
+fireworks!'
+At last my soul explodes, and wisely cries out to me: 'No matter where! No matter where! As long as it's out
+of the world!'

+To be developed in a coming time!
+Gomorrha, rampant with all vice and guilt

+Metropolis of satire and lampoon,
+Of wit, of elegance, of mirth, of song,
+And fearful tragedies done day by day,
+Which put our hair on end in the open streets
+The busy hive of awful memories,
+The potent arbiter of popular will,
+The great electric centre whence the shocks
+Of pulsing freedom vibrate through tbe world-
+Beautiful Paris! sacred to our hearts,
+With all thy folly, all thy wickedness-
+If but for Bailly, Vergniaud, Gensonne,
+And noblest Roland, she of Roman soul,
+And the great patriots and friends of man
+Who went to death for holy liberty-
+Lift up thy voice, O Paris! once again,
+And speak the thought that labours in thy breast;
+Shake off thy gauds and tinsels-be thyself;
+Cease thy lewd jests, and heartless revelries,
+Thy adoration of all worthless things,
+Thy scorn, thy sarcasm, and thy unbelief;
+And in the conflict and the march of men
+Do justice to thy nature, and complete
+The glorious work, so gloriously begun
+By the great souls of pregnant eighty-nine.
+Come forth, oh, Paris! freed from vice and stain,
+Like a young warrior dallying too long
+With loving women, wasting precious hours
+In base delights and enervating sloth;
+Who, when he shakes them off, puts back his hair
+From his broad brow, and places on his head
+The plumed helmet-throws his velvets off.
+And swathes his vigorous limbs in glancing steel.
+To lead true hearts to struggle for mankind.
+Or if no more, Soldier of Liberty!
+Thou 'lt lead the nations-stand upon the hill,
+And, like a prophet, preach a holy creed
+Of freedom, progress, peace, and happiness;
+And all the world shall listen to thy voice,
+And Tyranny, hyaena big with young,
+Dreading the sound, shall farrow in affright.
+And drop, still-born, her sanguinary cubs,
+And many a bloody feud be spared mankind.
+Poland again, with desperate grasp, shall seize
+The neck of her enslaver, and extort
+Full justice from his terror; Hungary,
+Ermined and crown'd, shall sit in her own seat
+In peaceful state and sober majesty;
+And Italy, unloosening her bonds
+By her strong will, shall be at last the home
+Of broadly based and virtuous liberty,
+And in her bosom nuture evermore,
+Not the fierce virtues of her Roman youth,
+But the calm blessings of her later time
+Science, and art, and civilizing trade,
+Divine philosophy, diviner song,
+And true religion reconciled with man.
+Speak out, O Paris! purify thyself
+By noble thoughts, and deeds will follow them.
+The world has need of thee. Humanity
+Droops for thy dalliance with degraded things,
+Alien, and most unworthy of the soul
+That sleeps within thee. Rouse thyself, O Paris!
+The time expects thee. Pyrenees, and Alps,
+And Appenines, and snow-clad Balkans, wait,
+With all their echoes, to repeat the words
+Which thou must utter! Thou hast slumber'd long
+Long dallied. Speak! The world will answer thee!

+From the first it had been like a
+Ballad. It had the beat inevitable. It had the blood.
+A wildness cut up, and tied in little bunches,
+Like the four-line stanzas of the ballads she had never quite
+understood--the ballads they had set her to, in school.
+Herself: the milk-white maid, the "maid mild"
+Of the ballad. Pursued
+By the Dark Villain. Rescued by the Fine Prince.
+The Happiness-Ever-After.
+That was worth anything.
+It was good to be a "maid mild."
+That made the breath go fast.
+Her bacon burned. She
+Hastened to hide it in the step-on can, and
+Drew more strips from the meat case. The eggs and sour-milk biscuits
+Did well. She set out a jar
+Of her new quince preserve.
+. . . But there was something about the matter of the Dark Villain.
+He should have been older, perhaps.
+The hacking down of a villain was more fun to think about
+When his menace possessed undisputed breath, undisputed height,
+And best of all, when history was cluttered
+With the bones of many eaten knights and princesses.
+The fun was disturbed, then all but nullified
+When the Dark Villain was a blackish child
+Of Fourteen, with eyes still too young to be dirty,
+And a mouth too young to have lost every reminder
+Of its infant softness.
+That boy must have been surprised! For
+These were grown-ups. Grown-ups were supposed to be wise.
+And the Fine Prince--and that other--so tall, so broad, so
+Grown! Perhaps the boy had never guessed
+That the trouble with grown-ups was that under the magnificent shell of adulthood, just under,
+Waited the baby full of tantrums.
+It occurred to her that there may have been something
+Ridiculous to the picture of the Fine Prince
+Rushing (rich with the breadth and height and
+Mature solidness whose lack, in the Dark Villain, was impressing her,
+Confronting her more and more as this first day after the trial
+And acquittal (wore on) rushing
+With his heavy companion to hack down (unhorsed)
+That little foe. So much had happened, she could not remember now what that foe had done
+Against her, or if anything had been done.
+The breaks were everywhere. That she could think
+Of no thread capable of the necessary
+Sew-work.
+She made the babies sit in their places at the table.
+Then, before calling HIM, she hurried
+To the mirror with her comb and lipstick. It was necessary
+To be more beautiful than ever.
+The beautiful wife.
+For sometimes she fancied he looked at her as though
+Measuring her. As if he considered, Had she been worth it?
+Had she been worth the blood, the cramped cries, the little stirring bravado, The gradual dulling of those Negro eyes,
+The sudden, overwhelming little-boyness in that barn?
+Whatever she might feel or half-feel, the lipstick necessity was something apart. HE must never conclude
+That she had not been worth it.
+HE sat down, the Fine Prince, and
+Began buttering a biscuit. HE looked at HIS hands.
+More papers were in from the North, HE mumbled. More maddening headlines.
+With their pepper-words, "bestiality," and "barbarism," and
+"Shocking."
+The half-sneers HE had mastered for the trial worked across
+HIS sweet and pretty face.
+What HE'd like to do, HE explained, was kill them all.
+The time lost. The unwanted fame.
+Still, it had been fun to show those intruders
+A thing or two. To show that snappy-eyed mother,
+That sassy, Northern, brown-black--
+Nothing could stop Mississippi.
+HE knew that. Big fella
+Knew that.
+And, what was so good, Mississippi knew that.
+They could send in their petitions, and scar
+Their newspapers with bleeding headlines. Their governors
+Could appeal to Washington . . .
+"What I want," the older baby said, "is 'lasses on my jam."
+Whereupon the younger baby
+Picked up the molasses pitcher and threw
+The molasses in his brother's face. Instantly
+The Fine Prince leaned across the table and slapped
+The small and smiling criminal.
+She did not speak. When the HAND
+Came down and away, and she could look at her child,
+At her baby-child,
+She could think only of blood.
+Surely her baby's cheek
+Had disappeared, and in its place, surely,
+Hung a heaviness, a lengthening red, a red that had no end.
+She shook her had. It was not true, of course.
+It was not true at all. The
+Child's face was as always, the
+Color of the paste in her paste-jar.
+She left the table, to the tune of the children's lamentations, which were shriller
+Than ever. She
+Looked out of a window. She said not a word. That
+Was one of the new Somethings--
+The fear,
+Tying her as with iron.
+Suddenly she felt his hands upon her. He had followed her
+To the window. The children were whimpering now.
+Such bits of tots. And she, their mother,
+Could not protect them. She looked at her shoulders, still
+Gripped in the claim of his hands. She tried, but could not resist the idea
+That a red ooze was seeping, spreading darkly, thickly, slowly,
+Over her white shoulders, her own shoulders,
+And over all of Earth and Mars.
+He whispered something to her, did the Fine Prince, something about love and night and intention.
+She heard no hoof-beat of the horse and saw no flash of the shining steel.
+He pulled her face around to meet
+His, and there it was, close close,
+For the first time in all the days and nights.
+His mouth, wet and red,
+So very, very, very red,
+Closed over hers.
+Then a sickness heaved within her. The courtroom Coca-Cola,
+The courtroom beer and hate and sweat and drone,
+Pushed like a wall against her. She wanted to bear it.
+But his mouth would not go away and neither would the
+Decapitated exclamation points in that Other Woman's eyes.
+She did not scream.
+She stood there.
+But a hatred for him burst into glorious flower,
+And its perfume enclasped them--big,
+Bigger than all magnolias.
+The last bleak news of the ballad.
+The rest of the rugged music.
+The last quatrain.

+Children are a marvel to observe

+Kneel down, fair Love, and fill thyself with tears,
+Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth
+Upon the sides of mirth,
+Cover thy lips and eyelids, let thine ears
+Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing;
+Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs
+Upon the flesh to cleave,
+Set pains therein and many a grievous thing,
+And many sorrows after each his wise
+For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve.
+O Love's lute heard about the lands of death,
+Left hanged upon the trees that were therein;
+O Love and Time and Sin,
+Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath,
+Three lovers, each one evil spoken of;
+O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine
+Came softer with her praise;
+Abide a little for our lady's love.
+The kisses of her mouth were more than wine,
+And more than peace the passage of her days.
+O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see.
+O Time, thou shalt not find in any land
+Till, cast out of thine hand,
+The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee,
+Another woman fashioned like as this.
+O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in her
+Was made a goodly thing;
+Yea, she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss,
+With her fair kiss, and lips much lovelier
+Than lips of amorous roses in late spring.
+By night there stood over against my bed
+Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black,
+Both sides drawn fully back
+From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red,
+And temples drained of purple and full of death.
+Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water
+And the sea's gold in it.
+Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth.
+Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her,
+And pearl and purple and amber on her feet.
+Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
+Were painted all the secret ways of love
+And covered things thereof,
+That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine;
+Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves,
+And brides that kept within the bride-chamber
+Their garment of soft shame,
+And weeping faces of the wearied loves
+That swoon in sleep and awake wearier,
+With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame.
+The tears that through her eyelids fell on me
+Made mine own bitter where they ran between
+As blood had fallen therein,
+She saying; Arise, lift up thine eyes and see
+If any glad thing be or any good
+Now the best thing is taken forth of us;
+Even she to whom all praise
+Was as one flower in a great multitude,
+One glorious flower of many and glorious,
+One day found gracious among many days:
+Even she whose handmaiden was Love--to whom
+At kissing times across her stateliest bed
+Kings bowed themselves and shed
+Pale wine, and honey with the honeycomb,
+And spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering;
+Even she between whose lips the kiss became
+As fire and frankincense;
+Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king,
+Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame,
+Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence.
+Then I beheld, and lo on the other side
+My lady's likeness crowned and robed and dead.
+Sweet still, but now not red,
+Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died.
+And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue shade,
+The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes.
+And sweet, but like spoilt gold,
+The weight of colour in her tresses weighed.
+And sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes,
+The body that was clothed with love of old.
+Ah! that my tears filled all her woven hair
+And all the hollow bosom of her gown--
+Ah! that my tears ran down
+Even to the place where many kisses were,
+Even where her parted breast-flowers have place,
+Even where they are cloven apart--who knows not this?
+Ah! the flowers cleave apart
+And their sweet fills the tender interspace;
+Ah! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss
+Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart.
+Ah! in the days when God did good to me,
+Each part about her was a righteous thing;
+Her mouth an almsgiving,
+The glory of her garments charity,
+The beauty of her bosom a good deed,
+In the good days when God kept sight of us;
+Love lay upon her eyes,
+And on that hair whereof the world takes heed;
+And all her body was more virtuous
+Than souls of women fashioned otherwise.
+Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine hands
+And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves
+Rain-rotten in rank lands,
+Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves
+And grass that fades ere any of it be mown;
+And when thy bosom is filled full thereof
+Seek out Death's face ere the light altereth,
+And say "My master that was thrall to Love
+Is become thrall to Death."
+Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and groan.
+But make no sojourn in thy outgoing;
+For haply it may be
+That when thy feet return at evening
+Death shall come in with thee.

+STRUCTURE & FORM IN POETRY.  Classical Poetry always has Structure even though it does not always rhyme. The Structure gives it metere and flow which facilitates reading and recitation. In my book - recitability is an essential character of a good Poem! . A lesser know Poetical Structure is RHYME ROYAL which inposes a strict metre (usually imabic pentameter)   and a strict rhyming pattern a b a b b c c. Each verse must consist of seven lines. The number of verses is optional!  As an Environmental Scientist I am concerned with the Conservation of Water which is the subject of this Rhyme Royal
+Whence comes this water that we need for life?
+Where does it go when we flush it away?
+A shortage in some countries causes strife
+Will it run out like coal and oil one day?
+For all resources there's a price to pay.
+We all use water - like it was for free
+Just turn the tap - it's there for you and me.
+God touched the clouds and made the rain - from the rain
+Formed the sea and from the sea formed the clouds
+To rise and cool and give us rain again.
+The rain provides the water for the crowds.
+When it evaporates it goes back to the clouds.
+Each dropp of water makes our lives secure
+But every day we're using more and more.
+The Planet Earth has water everywhere
+Liquid or a solid or a vapour
+In oceans - rivers - lakes and in the air
+Icecaps or on frozen lakes like paper.
+We scrape it off our windscreens with a scraper!
+Mountain stream - boiling steam and freezing snow
+A lolly ice?   Thanks very nice - It is all  H 2 O.
+The Water Cycle keeps the water going
+Round and round - none's lost to outer space
+Precipitation - raining - hailing - snowing
+Moves the water round from place to place.
+Especially when a snowball hits your face.
+Streams and rushing rivers keep it all in motion
+Then water falls down waterfalls and ends up in the ocean!
+Water Water everywhere - for our daily needs
+Turn the tap and use the river and the well
+Don't pollute - don't dam the spring that feeds
+Without 'clean water' life on Earth is Hell!
+Clean Water has no taste - no clour and no smell.
+Water Water everywhere - please please stop and think
+Water Water everywhere - but not one dropp to drink! ! ! ! !

+One night, in the dead of night
+Seven girls, one guy
+Watched the torture of a girl on TV
+The most disturbing, terrifying horror movie
+When the film reached the end
+Three girls and the guy got up and left
+Way past curfew, to the park
+With hopes to get scared in the dark
+While the other four girls' stayed at home
+Trying to figure out where to go
+Something else was happening...
+Shallow, low, and backstabbing
+The one guy in the group stole a bottle of brandy
+From my, one of the girls', kitchen pantry
+Did I mention I was his girlfriend?
+Having said that, you would think that would have stopped him!
+They passed it around
+As they sat at the playground
+Got a warm, fuzzy tingle
+And started to mingle
+So I guess,
+We'll call her 'S'
+And he,
+Will be called 'D'
+Apparently neither were thinking of me
+D licked candy off S's chest
+'D' then played with S's breasts
+They knew it was wrong, at least she did
+But the crime was done, lied and cheated
+When they got home and asked if they had fun
+They glanced at each other and said 'Uh huh.'
+From the guilty look in their twinkling eyes
+I had a gut a feeling something wasn't right
+Did they really think they would get away with this?
+Sweep it under the rug? Throw a blanket over it?
+Well in my book those aren't the rules
+I don't play like that, you fools
+As the night went on
+Tears were shed
+Trust was gone
+Apologies made
+Sincere hugs gave
+The love had stayed
+At least some, anyway
+D never made an apology
+D never kissed and made up with me
+He just grinned and held his head high
+He just stuck his chest to the sky
+Pretending everything was just alright
+Not even thinking of this crazy night
+In the end, I thought long and hard
+Gave him a second chance for a new start
+But he never did clean up his act
+So eventually I told him,
+'Hit the road Jack! '

+Like a broken Cinderella,

+There is no exit, no escape, no hope,
+And she is hanging from a noose rope.
+Broken Cinderella, broken Cinderella,
+You're over; a broken record,
+That cannot play, pain here to stay,
+No prettiness to escape to,
+No moving forward, only moving back,
+Trapped, dead, deceased, over and broken,
+With a torn dress, a torn gown,

+Leave her walking a lonely road,
+Almost crawling on the ground,
+Her heart an empty, cold stone,

+She wishes for mercy from the hot sun,

+Where is the window? she asks,
+Where is my future? A broken Cinderella,
+Broken, down and out,
+Living all by herself,
+With no helping hand,
+With no friend or stranger to understand.
+And she yearns to be fixed,
+She hopes to replace those bricks,
+That will make her a new home,
+A world where her heart carries no stone,
+And leaves her to fly in the blue sky,
+Her wings carrying her,

+I love to be free, among the clouds
+And dancing,
+It is here, where I meet with you,
+Among the clouds romancing.
+Unbinding are my hands,
+As you set me free
+You set my soul on fire
+Enchanted, I climb high and higher
+The pill, the coating
+My angel, my plaything
+Lighting flashes through the rain,
+You come walking clearing the way
+You move around me filling my chest, invoking emotions
+An Aphrodite teasing priestess, and here in the heat of the night
+And the light of the day, you remove everything
+That ever stood in my way
+The crash of confusion and the weight of dismay
+Is halted, lifted and taken away
+Replaced with enchantment and lyrical gift
+Smoothing over the cracks of inner personal rift
+The aches the pains, there all pulled away
+By horse drawn chariots, made of gold clay
+Enlightenment falls upon me, from emotional release
+In this realm where I lay with ease,  surrounded by passionate love and harmonious peace
+Your invoked emotions become entrancing
+My analgesic angel, my psychedelic plaything
+I take your hand, and you entwine with mine
+The air falls silently still, seduction of my mind and will
+I fall into you, you become one with me
+You are my paradise shore, I’m you amorous sea
+Frolicking in the surf with whispers of love,
+Transfiguration of its purity into the whitest of doves
+With exquisite form a launch from surf to sky
+And now air born once more we fly, into tranquillity
+Through the all Seeing Eye, a thunderous crash entering
+The kaleidoscope sky, toward our final nirvana and our ultimate heights
+As we now start the end of our heaven spent time in
+The world, the realms and the clouds of the sky, the
+Imprinted memories dress the sky as stars, and find the glowing
+Sparkling spectacle further more enchants my mind
+A roar thunder and a bolt of light the advancing
+Waves of clouds unite, approaching faster then
+A ferocious tide, time is almost up, on my
+Analgesic angel and on the only world I dearly love
+The air begins to whisper, a reduction of my mind and will
+You hand slips go as you leave and untwines itself from me
+My analgesic angel my psychedelic plaything
+You revoke the emotions that are still entrancing
+No more at ease, at a loss without the passionate love and harmonious peace
+The enlightenment lifts from me, from emotional retreat
+The horse drawn chariots made of gold clay
+Pulling the return of the aches and the pains
+Fracture again the surface of inner personal rift
+Retracted and chained is the enchantment and lyrical gift
+The crash of confusion and the weight of dismay
+Is returning heavy and heading my way
+Without the heat of the night and the light of the day
+Everything that returns will remain in my way
+Revoked emotions now fleeing my chest, from a retreating
+Aphrodite teasing priestess
+The pill, the coating
+My angel, my plaything
+Lighting flashes bringing the rain,
+You go leaving and obscuring the way
+Binding are my hands,
+As without you I’m not free
+Extinguish my burning soul
+Disenchanted, I fall, fall and fall
+I love to be free, among the clouds
+And dancing,
+And I will return in time, as this
+World of realms and rhymes
+Resides discreetly, somewhere in my mind

+You danced alone like a peasant

+I walk among the rows of bowed heads--
+the children are sleeping through fourth grade

+and the rush forward tearing their wings
+loose and turning their eyes forever inward.
+These are the children of Flint, their fathers
+work at the spark plug factory or truck
+bottled water in 5 gallon sea-blue jugs
+to the widows of the suburbs. You can see
+already how their backs have thickened,
+how their small hands, soiled by pig iron,
+leap and stutter even in dreams. I would like
+to sit down among them and read slowly
+from The Book of Job until the windows
+pale and the teacher rises out of a milky sea
+of industrial scum, her gowns streaming
+with light, her foolish words transformed
+into song, I would like to arm each one
+with a quiver of arrows so that they might
+rush like wind there where no battle rages
+shouting among the trumpets, Hal Ha!
+How dear the gift of laughter in the face
+of the 8 hour day, the cold winter mornings
+without coffee and oranges, the long lines
+of mothers in old coats waiting silently
+where the gates have closed. Ten years ago
+I went among these same children, just born,
+in the bright ward of the Sacred Heart and leaned
+down to hear their breaths delivered that day,
+burning with joy. There was such wonder
+in their sleep, such purpose in their eyes
+dosed against autumn, in their damp heads
+blurred with the hair of ponds, and not one
+turned against me or the light, not one
+said, I am sick, I am tired, I will go home,
+not one complained or drifted alone,
+unloved, on the hardest day of their lives.
+Eleven years from now they will become
+the men and women of Flint or Paradise,
+the majors of a minor town, and I
+will be gone into smoke or memory,
+so I bow to them here and whisper

+Sun soaked revelations
+on a patio deck.
+I had long forgotten
+the simple joys
+Of returning to origin.
+In its bosom,
+the well worn comfort
+Of familiarity,
+combined with the
+clear remembrance
+Of lake breeze air.
+Every milestone,
+And accomplishment,
+All seen by the unending tide
+Of water in motion.
+From the eyes of my window:
+the first breath of my brother
+and the last sight of my cousin.
+The first taste of a woman
+and my last meeting with her.
+All trials,
+Tribulations,
+And friendships
+Have come, gone
+and began again
+here.
+Lonely winter nights,
+The ferocity of the wind off the beach
+almost too much to bear.
+Nowhere to go,
+Except the solace of a guitar,
+You taught yourself well back then.
+My first car,
+Driving around in circles,
+a “summer town” deserted in the winter,
+And a father
+Eager to pass this rite to his son.
+Later,
+Cracks in a marriage,
+like holes in a wall,
+and a lonely teenager hoping for the best.
+Ultimately,
+reconciliation.
+My first taste of addiction.
+Parents out of town,
+I wanted to be the “cool kid”.
+A party remembered,
+The stench of cigarettes,
+Never
+Again
+Forgotten.
+All within these walls.
+Outside,
+Clear hot air.
+I lay back
+And gaze deeply
+Into the trunk,
+of the tree,
+I have seen all
+My life.
+My great aunt used to tell me
+that on the branches,
+Of this particular tree
+Sits a wise old owl.
+He will watch over you
+During this life.
+To a child
+An owl shaped branch,
+Can give breath quite easily.
+Yet I never truly understood
+Her message.
+Now
+That branch is long since gone,
+As is she.
+And at times when I need her wisdom
+Most
+I remember the owl.
+Today it is clear to me.
+Just as the roots
+Of a tree anchor
+mighty oak,
+My home
+Anchors me.
+I lay back
+In my chair.
+Feet up,
+exhalation.
+I am home,
+Rooted once again.

+Abuse
+He was little at the time,
+She was only a child,
+But both were abused,
+And had been for a while.
+Their father was cruel,
+Mean and heartless.
+The way he hurt them,
+Made it look effortless.
+He locked her up,
+In a room up the stair.
+And left the house drunk,
+Leaving her there.
+He was hit from the mum,
+A blow to the face.
+The way they were treated,
+Was an utter disgrace.
+He couldn't get up,
+He couldn't fight back.
+For food to get stronger,
+Was something he lacked.
+The little girl was left,
+Alone in the dark.
+Cradling her arm,
+On which was a mark.
+Her wrist had been used,
+To put out a cigarette stump.
+Buring through the skin,
+Leaving her with a lump.
+He had been kicked,
+When he was down.
+Kicked for just being there,
+Kicked down to the ground.
+She had been someone,
+For her parents alone,
+To personally hurt,
+When they were at home.
+These children were hurt,
+Outside and in.
+They'd been physically abused,
+And hurt right within.
+Their pride had been banished,
+Long, long ago.
+They couldn't stand up,
+And simply say, 'No! '
+The children died,
+Not older than three.
+The boy protecting his sister,
+The girl clutching her teddy.
+They had bruises,
+Up and down their arms.
+But they had escaped,
+Escaped from further harm.
+I wish that I could have,
+Had the courage to speak.
+To tell someone of this abuse,
+That happened each week.
+I could have made a difference,
+For this little boy and girl,
+I could have made a difference,
+That they could mean the whole world.

+The memory of you emerges from the night around me.
+The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.
+Deserted like the wharves at dawn.
+It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one!
+Cold flower heads are raining over my heart.
+Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.
+In you the wars and the flights accumulated.
+From you the wings of the song birds rose.
+You swallowed everything, like distance.
+Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank!
+It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss.
+The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse.
+Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver,
+turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank!
+In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded.
+Lost discoverer, in you everything sank!
+You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire,
+sadness stunned you, in you everything sank!
+I made the wall of shadow draw back,
+beyond desire and act, I walked on.
+Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost,
+I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you.
+Like a jar you housed infinite tenderness.
+and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar.
+There was the black solitude of the islands,
+and there, woman of love, your arms took me in.
+There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit.
+There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle.
+Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain me
+in the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms!
+How terrible and brief my desire was to you!
+How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid.
+Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs,
+still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds.
+Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs,
+oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies.
+Oh the mad coupling of hope and force
+in which we merged and despaired.
+And the tenderness, light as water and as flour.
+And the word scarcely begun on the lips.
+This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing,
+and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank!
+Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you,
+what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not drowned!
+From billow to billow you still called and sang.
+Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel.
+You still flowered in songs, you still brike the currents.
+Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well.
+Pale blind diver, luckless slinger,
+lost discoverer, in you everything sank!
+It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hour
+which the night fastens to all the timetables.
+The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore.
+Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate.
+Deserted like the wharves at dawn.
+Only tremulous shadow twists in my hands.
+Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything.
+It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!

+Each answered,

+Two sets
+of family stories,
+one long and detailed,
+about many centuries
+of island ancestors, all living
+on the same tropical farm...
+The other side of the family tells stories
+that are brief and vague, about violence
+in the Ukraine, which Dad's parents
+had to flee forever, leaving all their
+loved ones
+behind.
+They don't even know if anyone
+survived.
+When Mami tells her flowery tales of Cuba,
+she fills the twining words with relatives.
+But when I ask my
+Ukrainian-Jewish-American grandma
+about her childhood in a village
+near snowy Kiev,
+all she reveals is a single
+memory
+of ice-skating
+on a frozen pond.
+Apparently, the length
+of a grown-up's
+growing-up story
+is determined
+by the difference
+between immigration
+and escape.
+Mad has decided to catch a vulture,
+the biggest bird she can find.
+ 
+She is so determined, and so inventive,
+that by stringing together a rickety trap
+of ropes and sticks, she creates
+a puzzling structure that just might
+be clever enough to trick a buzzard,
+once the trap’s baited with leftover pork
+from supper.
+Mad and I used to do everything together,
+but now I need a project all my own,
+so I roam the green fields,
+finding bones.
+The skull of a wild boar.
+The jawbone of a mule.
+Older cousins show me
+how to shake the mule’s quijada,
+to make the blunt teeth
+rattle.
+Guitars.
+Drums.
+Gourds.
+Sticks.
+A cow bell.
+A washboard.
+Pretty soon, we have
+a whole orchestra.
+On Cuban farms, even death
+can turn into
+music.
+City life is a whirl of poetry readings
+and forbidden tertulias, gatherings
+where young and old, rich and poor,
+male and female, dark and light—
+runaway slaves and freed ones,
+former masters and former
+servants—all take turns
+sharing secret verses
+rooted in startling
+new ideas.
+Each evening, I go home
+with a mind that glows
+in the light of words,
+which leap
+like flames.
+Time was away and somewhere else,
+There were two glasses and two chairs
+And two people with the one pulse
+(Somebody stopped the moving stairs):
+Time was away and somewhere else.
+And they were neither up nor down;
+The stream’s music did not stop
+Flowing through heather, limpid brown,
+Although they sat in a coffee shop
+And they were neither up nor down.
+The bell was silent in the air
+Holding its inverted poise—
+Between the clang and clang a flower,
+A brazen calyx of no noise:
+The bell was silent in the air.
+The camels crossed the miles of sand
+That stretched around the cups and plates;
+The desert was their own, they planned
+To portion out the stars and dates:
+The camels crossed the miles of sand.
+Time was away and somewhere else.
+The waiter did not come, the clock
+Forgot them and the radio waltz
+Came out like water from a rock:
+Time was away and somewhere else.
+Her fingers flicked away the ash
+That bloomed again in tropic trees:
+Not caring if the markets crash
+When they had forests such as these,
+Her fingers flicked away the ash.
+God or whatever means the Good
+Be praised that time can stop like this,
+That what the heart has understood
+Can verify in the body’s peace
+God or whatever means the Good.
+Time was away and she was here
+And life no longer what it was,
+The bell was silent in the air
+And all the room one glow because
+Time was away and she was here.
+It is patent to the eye that cannot face the sun
+The smug philosophers lie who say the world is one;
+World is other and other, world is here and there,
+Parmenides would smother life for lack of air
+Precluding birth and death; his crystal never breaks—
+No movement and no breath, no progress nor mistakes,
+Nothing begins or ends, no one loves or fights,
+All your foes are friends and all your days are nights
+And all the roads lead round and are not roads at all
+And the soul is muscle-bound, the world a wooden ball.
+The modern monist too castrates, negates our lives
+And nothing that we do, make or become survives,
+His terror of confusion freezes the flowing stream
+Into mere illusion, his craving for supreme
+Completeness means be chokes each orifice with tight
+Plaster as he evokes a dead ideal of white
+All-white Universal, refusing to allow
+Division or dispersal—Eternity is now
+And Now is therefore numb, a fact he does not see
+Postulating a dumb static identity
+Of Essence and Existence which could not fuse without
+Banishing to a distance belief along with doubt,
+Action along with error, growth along with gaps;
+If man is a mere mirror of God, the gods collapse.
+No, the formula fails that fails to make it clear
+That only change prevails, that the seasons make the year,
+That a thing, a beast, a man is what it is because
+It is something that began and is not what it was,
+Yet is itself throughout, fluttering and unfurled,
+Not to be cancelled out, not to be merged in world,
+Its entity a denial of all that is not it,
+Its every move a trial through chaos and the Pit,
+An absolute and so defiant of the One
+Absolute, the row of noughts where time is done,
+Where nothing goes or comes and Is is one with Ought
+And all the possible sums alike resolve to nought.
+World is not like that, world is full of blind
+Gulfs across the flat, jags against the mind,
+Swollen or diminished according to the dice,
+Foaming, never finished, never the same twice.
+You talk of Ultimate Value, Universal Form—
+Visions, let me tell you, that ride upon the storm
+And must be made and sought but cannot be maintained,
+Lost as soon as caught, always to be regained,
+Mainspring of our striving towards perfection, yet
+Would not be worth achieving if the world were set
+Fair, if error and choice did not exist, if dumb
+World should find its voice for good and God become
+Incarnate once for all. No, perfection means
+Something but must fall unless there intervenes
+Between that meaning and the matter it should fill
+Time’s revolving hand that never can be still.
+Which being so and life a ferment, you and I
+Can only live by strife in that the living die,
+And, if we use the word Eternal, stake a claim
+Only to what a bird can find within the frame
+Of momentary flight (the value will persist
+But as event the night sweeps it away in mist).
+Man is man because he might have been a beast
+And is not what he was and feels himself increased,
+Man is man in as much as he is not god and yet
+Hankers to see and touch the pantheon and forget
+The means within the end and man is truly man
+In that he would transcend and flout the human span:
+A species become rich by seeing things as wrong
+And patching them, to which I am proud that I belong.
+Man is surely mad with discontent, he is hurled
+By lovely hopes or bad dreams against the world,
+Raising a frail scaffold in never-ending flux,
+Stubbornly when baffled fumbling the stubborn crux
+And so he must continue, raiding the abyss
+With aching bone and sinew, conscious of things amiss,
+Conscious of guilt and vast inadequacy and the sick
+Ego and the broken past and the clock that goes too quick,
+Conscious of waste of labour, conscious of spite and hate,
+Of dissension with his neighbour, of beggars at the gate,
+But conscious also of love and the joy of things and the power
+Of going beyond and above the limits of the lagging hour,
+Conscious of sunlight, conscious of death’s inveigling touch,
+Not completely conscious but partly—and that is much.
+The room was suddenly rich and the great bay-window was
+Spawning snow and pink roses against it
+Soundlessly collateral and incompatible:
+World is suddener than we fancy it.
+World is crazier and more of it than we think,
+Incorrigibly plural. I peel and portion
+A tangerine and spit the pips and feel
+The drunkenness of things being various.
+And the fire flames with a bubbling sound for world
+Is more spiteful and gay than one supposes— 
+On the tongue on the eyes on the ears in the palms of one's hands—
+There is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses.
+Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
+Robert Frost poetAnd sorry I could not travel both
+And be one traveler, long I stood
+And looked down one as far as I could
+To where it bent in the undergrowth;
+Then took the other, as just as fair,
+And having perhaps the better claim,
+Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
+Though as for that the passing there
+Had worn them really about the same,
+And both that morning equally lay
+In leaves no step had trodden black.
+Oh, I kept the first for another day!
+Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
+I doubted if I should ever come back.
+I shall be telling this with a sigh
+Somewhere ages and ages hence:
+Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
+I took the one less traveled by,
+And that has made all the difference.
+Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness,
+Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
+Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
+A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
+What leaf-fring’d legend haunts about thy shape
+Of deities or mortals, or of both,
+In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
+What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
+What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
+What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
+Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
+Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
+Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear’d,
+Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
+Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
+Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
+Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
+Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;
+She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
+For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!
+Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
+Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
+And, happy melodist, unwearied,
+For ever piping songs for ever new;
+More happy love! more happy, happy love!
+For ever warm and still to be enjoy’d,
+For ever panting, and for ever young;
+All breathing human passion far above,
+That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy’d,
+A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.
+Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
+To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
+Lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
+And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
+What little town by river or sea shore,
+Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
+Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
+And, little town, thy streets for evermore
+Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
+Why thou art desolate, can e’er return.
+O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
+Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
+With forest branches and the trodden weed;
+Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
+As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
+When old age shall this generation waste,
+Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
+Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say’st,
+“Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all
+Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”
+Tiger Tiger, burning bright,
+In the forests of the night;
+What immortal hand or eye,
+Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
+In what distant deeps or skies.
+Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
+On what wings dare he aspire?
+What the hand, dare seize the fire?
+And what shoulder, and what art,
+Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
+And when thy heart began to beat,
+What dread hand? and what dread feet?
+What the hammer? what the chain,
+In what furnace was thy brain?
+What the anvil? what dread grasp,
+Dare its deadly terrors clasp!
+When the stars threw down their spears
+And water’d heaven with their tears:
+Did he smile his work to see?
+Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
+Tiger Tiger burning bright,
+In the forests of the night:
+What immortal hand or eye,
+Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
+Whenever we wake,
+still joined, enraptured—
+at the window,
+each clear night’s finish
+the black pulse of dominoes
+dropping to land;
+whenever we embrace,
+haunted, upwelling,
+I know
+a reunion is taking place—      
+Hear me when I say
+our love’s not meant to be
+an opiate;
+helpmate,
+you are the reachable mirror
+that dares me to risk
+the caravan back
+to the apogee, the longed-for
+arms of the Beloved—
+Dusks of paperwhites,
+dusks of jasmine,
+intimate beyond belief
+beautiful Signor
+no dread of nakedness
+beautiful Signor
+my long ship,
+my opulence,
+my garland
+beautiful Signor
+extinguishing the beggar’s tin,
+the wind of longing
+beautiful Signor
+laving the ruined country,
+the heart wedded to war
+beautiful Signor
+the kiln-blaze
+in my body,
+the turning heaven
+beautiful Signor
+you cover me with pollen
+beautiful Signor
+into your sweet mouth—
+This is the taproot:
+against all strictures,
+desecrations,
+I’ll never renounce,
+never relinquish
+the first radiance, the first
+moment you took my hand—
+This is the endless wanderlust:
+dervish,
+yours is the April-upon-April love
+that kept me spinning even beyond
+your eventful arms
+toward the unsurpassed:
+the one vast claiming heart,
+the glimmering,
+the beautiful and revealed Signor.
+In the years I’ve been at this
+(Lots, not to be precise)
+You’d think that once or twice
+At least I would have seen
+Some anomalies. I mean
+Some major ones. As in
+Not feet but little wheels,
+Or crests like cockatiels’.
+Where are they keeping the girls
+With a chrome exterior,
+Or an extra derriere?
+Apparently nowhere.
+Assuming my sample’s valid,
+The pool is limited
+To the standard types I’ve tallied;
+Such variance as there is
+In the usual congeries
+Of   physiognomies —
+And yet enough of   it
+To be worth the looking at.
+The walking by, for that,
+Of   the same girl over and over
+Would be no cross to bear
+If   it were that one there.
+Life, like a marble block, is given to all,
+A blank, inchoate mass of years and days,
+Whence one with ardent chisel swift essays
+Some shape of strength or symmetry to call;
+One shatters it in bits to mend a wall;
+One in a craftier hand the chisel lays,
+And one, to wake the mirth in Lesbia’s gaze,
+Carves it apace in toys fantastical.
+But least is he who, with enchanted eyes
+Filled with high visions of fair shapes to be,
+Muses which god he shall immortalize
+In the proud Parian’s perpetuity,
+Till twilight warns him from the punctual skies
+That the night cometh wherein none shall see.
+What I envy in the open eyes
+of the dead deer hanging down
+from the rafters, its eyes
+still wet and glassy, but locked now
+into a vision of another life,
+is the way it seems to be
+staring at the moment when
+it died. The blue light
+falling through the window
+into this smoke-filled room
+is the same color as the mist
+coming down off the mountain
+that morning: the deer sees
+men with guns
+but also sees, beyond them,
+the endless mountains.
+Oh, but to fade, and live we know not where,
+To be a cold obstruction and to groan!
+This sensible, warm woman to become
+A prudish clod; and the delighted spirit
+To live and die alone, or to reside
+With married sisters, and to have the care
+Of half a dozen children, not your own;
+And driven, for no one wants you,
+Round the pendant world; or worse than worse
+Of those that disappointment and pure spite
+Have driven to madness: ’Tis too horrible!
+The weariest and most troubled married life
+That age, ache, penury, or jealousy
+Can lay on nature, is a paradise
+To being an old maid.
+That very time I saw, (but thou couldst not,)
+Walking between the garden and the barn,
+Reuben, all armed; a certain aim he took
+At a young chicken standing by a post,
+And loosed his bullet smartly from his gun,
+As he would kill a hundred thousand hens.
+But I might see young Reuben’s fiery shot
+Lodged in the chaste board of the garden fence,
+And the domesticated fowl passed on,
+In henly meditation, bullet free.
+My father had a daughter got a man,
+As it might be, perhaps, were I good-looking,
+I should, your lordship.
+And what’s her residence?
+A hut my lord, she never owned a house,
+But let her husband, like a graceless scamp,
+Spend all her little means,—she thought she ought,—
+And in a wretched chamber, on an alley,
+She worked like masons on a monument,
+Earning their bread. Was not this love indeed?
+Others abide our question. Thou art free.
+We ask and ask—Thou smilest and art still,
+Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill,
+Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,
+Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,
+Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,
+Spares but the cloudy border of his base
+To the foil'd searching of mortality;
+And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,
+Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure,
+Didst tread on earth unguess'd at.—Better so!
+All pains the immortal spirit must endure,
+All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,
+Find their sole speech in that victorious brow.
+Spirit of BEAUTY, that dost consecrate
+With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon
+Of human thought or form, where art thou gone?
+Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,
+This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?
+Ask why the sunlight not for ever
+Weaves rainbows o’er yon mountain-river,
+Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown,
+Why fear and dream and death and birth
+Cast on the daylight of this earth
+Such gloom, why man has such a scope
+For love and hate, despondency and hope?
+It doesn't interest me
+what you do for a living.
+I want to know
+what you ache for
+and if you dare to dream
+of meeting your heart's longing.
+It doesn't interest me
+how old you are.
+I want to know
+if you will risk
+looking like a fool
+for love
+for your dream
+for the adventure of being alive.
+It doesn’t interest me
+what planets are
+squaring your moon...
+I want to know
+if you have touched
+the centre of your own sorrow
+if you have been opened
+by life's betrayals
+or have become shrivelled and closed
+from fear of further pain.
+I want to know
+if you can sit with pain
+mine or your own
+without moving to hide it
+or fade it
+or fix it.
+I want to know
+if you can be with joy
+mine or your own
+if you can dance with wildness
+and let the ecstasy fill you
+to the tips of your fingers and toes
+without cautioning us
+to be careful
+to be realistic
+to remember the limitations
+of being human.
+It doesn't interest me
+if the story you are telling me
+is true.
+I want to know if you can
+disappoint another
+to be true to yourself.
+If you can bear
+the accusation of betrayal
+and not betray your own soul.
+If you can be faithless
+and therefore trustworthy.
+I want to know if you can see Beauty
+even when it is not pretty
+every day.
+And if you can source your own life
+from its presence.
+I want to know
+if you can live with failure
+yours and mine
+and still stand at the edge of the lake
+and shout to the silver of the full moon,
+"Yes."
+It doesn't interest me
+to know where you live
+or how much money you have.
+I want to know if you can get up
+after the night of grief and despair
+weary and bruised to the bone
+and do what needs to be done
+to feed the children.
+It doesn't interest me
+who you know
+or how you came to be here.
+I want to know if you will stand
+in the centre of the fire
+with me
+and not shrink back.
+It doesn't interest me
+where or what or with whom
+you have studied.
+I want to know
+what sustains you
+from the inside
+when all else falls away.
+I want to know
+if you can be alone
+with yourself
+and if you truly like
+the company you keep
+in the empty moments.
+Do not go gentle into that good night,
+Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
+Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
+Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
+Because their words had forked no lightning they
+Do not go gentle into that good night.
+Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
+Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
+Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
+Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
+And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
+Do not go gentle into that good night.
+Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
+Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
+Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
+And you, my father, there on the sad height,
+Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
+Do not go gentle into that good night.
+Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
+Last night, when the moon
+slipped into my attic room
+as an oblong of light,
+I sensed she’d come to commiserate.
+It was August. She traveled
+with a small valise
+of darkness, and the first few stars
+returning to the northern sky,
+and my room, it seemed,
+had missed her. She pretended
+an interest in the bookcase
+while other objects
+stirred, as in a rock pool,
+with unexpected life:
+strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed,
+the paper-crowded desk;
+the books, too, appeared inclined
+to open and confess.
+Being sure the moon
+harbored some intention,
+I waited; watched for an age
+her cool gaze shift
+first toward a flower sketch
+pinned on the far wall
+then glide down to recline
+along the pinewood floor,
+before I’d had enough. Moon,
+I said, We’re both scarred now.
+Are they quite beyond you,
+the simple words of love? Say them.
+You are not my mother;
+with my mother, I waited unto death.
+I was so worried the hickory I recognized
+had died from salt burn in the last hurricane
+I may have passed by vervain and apple haw
+like they didn’t matter, but this spring
+it put out seven shoots from its base.
+Still, the oldest trick is the moon missing,
+then the “new” moon appears,
+though we know it’s the old one, and we pretend
+to be taken in like the mother or baby
+behind the bath towel.
+Really it’s the moon winking,
+being the stone that holds stones and now footprints.
+And when I tell Frances, I see she is a moon
+motionless in the doorway, skin reflecting
+a lamp, a face that awakens on paper.
+Come all ye maidens young and fair
+And you that are blooming in your prime
+Always beware and keep your garden fair
+Let no man steal away your thyme
+For thyme it is a precious thing
+And thyme brings all things to my mind
+nlyme with all its flavours, along with all its joys
+Thyme, brings all things to my mind
+Once I and a bunch of thyme
+i thought it never would decay
+Then came a lusty sailor
+Who chanced to pass my way
+And stole my bunch of thyme away
+The sailor gave to me a rose
+A rose that never would decay
+He gave it to me to keep me reminded
+Of when he stole my thyme away
+Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee
+All through the night
+Guardian angels God will send thee
+Soft the drowsy hours are creeping
+Hill and dale in slumber sleeping
+I my loving vigil keeping
+While the moon her watch is keeping
+While the weary world is sleeping
+Oer thy spirit gently stealing
+Visions of delight revealing
+Breathes a pure and holy feeling
+Though I roam a minstrel lonely
+My true harp shall praise sing only
+Loves young dream, alas, is over
+Yet my strains of love shall hover
+Near the presence of my lover
+Hark, a solemn bell is ringing
+Clear through the night
+Thou, my love, art heavenward winging
+Home through the night
+Earthly dust from off thee shaken
+Soul immortal shalt thou awaken
+With thy last dim journey taken
+Oh please neer forget me though waves now lie oer me
+I was once young and pretty and my spirit ran free
+But destiny tore me from country and loved ones
+And from the new land I was never to see.
+A poor emigrants daughter too frightened to know
+I was leaving forever the land of my soul
+Amid struggle and fear my parents did pray
+To place courage to leave oer the longing to stay.
+They spoke of a new land far away cross the sea
+And of peace and good fortune for my brothers and me
+So we parted from townland with much weeping and pain
+Kissed the loved ones and the friends we would neer see again.
+The vessel was crowded with disquieted folk
+The escape from past hardship sustaining their hope
+But as the last glimpse of Ireland faded into the mist
+Each one fought back tears and felt strangely alone.
+The seas roared in anger, making desperate our plight
+And a fever came oer me that worsened next night
+Then delirium possessed me and clouded my mind
+And I for a moment saw that land left behind.
+I could hear in the distance my dear mothers wailing
+And the prayers of three brothers that Id see no more
+And I felt fathers tears as he begged for forgiveness
+For seeking a new life on the still distant shore.
+Over in Killarney
+Many years ago,
+Me Mither sang a song to me
+In tones so sweet and low.
+Just a simple little ditty,
+In her good ould Irish way,
+And ld give the world if she could sing
+That song to me this day.
+Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
+Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, hush now, dont you cry!
+Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, thats an Irish lullaby.
+Oft in dreams I wander
+To that cot again,
+I feel her arms a-huggin me
+As when she held me then.
+And I hear her voice a -hummin
+To me as in days of yore,
+When she used to rock me fast asleep
+Outside the cabin door.
+And who are you, me pretty fair maid
+And who are you, me honey?
+She answered me quite modestly:
+I am me mothers darling.
+With me too-ry-ay
+Fol-de-diddle-day
+Di-re fol-de-diddle
+Dai-rie oh.
+And will you come to me mothers house,
+When the sun is shining clearly
+Ill open the door and Ill let you in
+And divil o one would hear us.
+So I went to her house in the middle of the night
+When the moon was shining clearly
+Shc opened the door and she let me in
+And divil the one did hear us.
+She took me horse by the bridle and the bit
+And she led him to the stable
+Saying Theres plenty of oats for a soldiers horse,
+To eat it if hes able.
+Then she took me by the lily-white hand
+And she led me to the table
+Saying: Theres plenty of wine for a soldier boy,
+To drink it if youre able.
+Then I got up and made the bed
+And I made it nice and aisy
+Then I got up and laid her down
+Saying: Lassie, are you able?
+And there we lay till the break of day
+And divil a one did hear us
+Then I arose and put on me clothes
+Saying: Lassie, I must leave you.
+And when will you return again
+And when will we get married
+When broken shells make Christmas bells
+We might well get married
+In 1803 we sailed out to sea
+Out from the sweet town of Derry
+For Australia bound if we didnt all drown
+And the marks of our fetters we carried.
+In the rusty iron chains we sighed for our wains
+As our good wives we left in sorrow.
+As the mainsails unfurled our curses we hurled
+On the English and thoughts of tomorrow.
+Oh Oh Oh Oh I wish I was back home in Derry.
+I cursed them to hell as our bow fought the swell.
+Our ship danced like a moth in the firelights.
+White horses rode high as the devil passed by
+Taking souls to Hades by twilight.
+Five weeks out to sea we were now forty-three
+Our comrades we buried each morning.
+In our own slime we were lost in a time.
+Endless night without dawning.
+Van Diemans land is a hell for a man
+To live out his life in slavery.
+When the climate is raw and the gun makes the law.
+Neither wind nor rain cares for bravery.
+Twenty years have gone by and Ive ended me bond
+And comrades ghosts are behind me.
+A rebel I came and III die the same.
+On the cold winds of night you will find me
+On the banks of the roses, my love and I sat down
+And I took out my violin to play my love a tune
+In the middle of the tune, O she sighed and she said
+O Johnny, lovely Johnny, Would you leave me
+O when I was a young man, I heard my father say
+That hed rather see me dead and buried in the clay
+Sooner than be married to any runaway
+By the lovely sweet banks of the roses
+O then I am no runaway and soon Ill let them know
+I can take a good glass or leave it alone
+And the man that doesnt like me, he can keep
+his daughter home
+And young Johnny will go roving with another
+And if ever I get married, twill be in the month of May
+When the leaves they are green and the meadows
+they are gay
+And I and my true love can sit and sport and play
+On the lovely sweet banks of the roses
+But Black is the colour of my true loves hair.
+His face is like some rosy fair,
+The prettiest face and the neatest hands,
+I love the ground whereon he stands.
+I love my love and well he knows
+I love the ground whereon he goes
+If you no more on earth I see,
+I cant serve you as you have me.
+The winters passed and the leaves are green
+The time is passed that we have seen,
+But still I hope the time will come
+When you and I shall be as one.
+I go to the Clyde for to mourn and weep,
+But satisfied I never could sleep,
+Ill write to you a few short lines
+Ill suffer death ten thousand times.
+So fare you well, my own true love
+The time has passed, but I wish you well.
+When you and I will be as one.
+I love the ground whereon he goes,
+The prettiest face, the neatest hands
+Her eyes they shone like the diamonds
+Youd think she was queen of the land
+And her hair hung over her shoulder
+Tied up with a black velvet band.
+In a neat little town they call Belfast
+Apprenticed to trade I was bound
+And many an hours sweet happiness
+I spent in that neat little town.
+Till bad misfortune came oer me
+That caused me to stray from the land
+Far away from my friends and relations
+To follow the black velvet band.
+Well, I was out strolling one evening
+Not meaning to go very far
+When I met with a pretty young damsel
+Who was selling her trade in the bar.
+When I watched, she took from a customer
+And slipped it right into my hand
+Then the Watch came and put me in prison
+Bad luck to the black velvet band.
+Next morning before judge and jury
+For a trial I had to appear
+And the judge, he said, You young fellows...
+The case against you is quite clear
+And seven long years is your sentence
+Youre going to Van Diemans Land
+Far away from your friends and relations
+So come all you jolly young fellows
+Id have you take warning by me
+Whenever youre out on the liquor, me lads,
+Beware of the pretty colleen.
+Shell fill you with whiskey and porter
+Until youre not able to stand
+And the very next thing that youll know, me lads,
+Youre landed in Van Diemans Land.
+Heres a health to you, bonnie Kellswater
+For its there youll find the pleasures of life
+And its there youll find a fishing and farming
+And a bonnie wee girl for your wife
+On the hills and the glens and the valleys
+Grows the softest of women so fine
+And the flowers are all dripping with honey
+There lives Martha, a true love of mine
+Bonnie Martha, youre the first girl I courted
+Youre the one put my heart in a snare
+And if ever I should lose you to another
+I will leave my Kellswater so fair
+For this one and that one may court her
+But no other can take her from me
+For I love her as I love my Kellswater
+Like the primrose is loved by the bee
+Oh Bridgit OMalley, you left my heart shaken
+With a hopeless desolation, Id have you to know
+Its the wonders of admiration your quiet face has taken
+And your beauty will haunt me wherever I go.
+The white moon above the pale sands, the pale stars above the thorn tree
+Are cold beside my darling, but no purer than she
+I gaze upon the cold moon till the stars drown in the warm sea
+And the bright eyes of my darling are never on me.
+My Sunday it is weary, my Sunday it is grey now
+My heart is a cold thing, my heart is a stone
+All joy is dead within me, my life has gone away now
+For another has taken my love for his own.
+The day it is approaching when we were to be married
+And its rather I would die than live only to grieve
+Oh meet me, my Darling, eer the sun sets oer the barley
+And Ill meet you there on the road to Drumslieve.
+Oh Bridgit OMalley, youve left my heart shaken
+I wish I was in Carrigfergus
+Only for nights in Ballygrant
+I would swim over the deepest ocean
+For my love to find
+But the sea is wide and I cannot cross over
+And neither have I the wings to fly
+I wish I could meet a handsome boatsman
+To ferry me over, to my love and die.
+My childhood days bring back sad reflections
+Of happy times I spent so long ago
+My boyhood friends and my own relations
+Have all passed on now like melting snow.
+But Ill spend my days in endless roaming
+Soft is the grass, my bed is free.
+Ah, to be back now in Carrigfergus
+On that long road down to the sea.
+But in Kilkenny, it is reported
+On marble stones there as black as ink
+With gold and silver I would support her
+But Ill sing no more till I get a drink.
+For Im drunk today, and Im seldom sober
+A handsome rover from town to town
+Ah, but Im sick now, my days are numbered
+You may travel far far from your own native land
+Far away oer the mountains, far away oer the foam
+But of all the fine places that Ive ever been
+Sure theres none can compare with the cliffs of Doneen.
+Take a view oer the mountains, fine sights youll see there
+Youll see the high rocky mountains oer the west coast of Clare
+Oh the town of Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen
+From the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Doneen.
+Its a nice place to be on a fine summers day
+Watching all the wild flowers that neer do decay
+Oh the hares and lofty pheasants are plain to be seen
+Making homes for their young round the cliffs of Doneen.
+Fare thee well to Doneen, fare thee well for a while
+And to all the kind people Im leaving behind
+To the streams and the meadows where late I have been
+And the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Doneen.
+In Dublins fair city, where the girls are so pretty
+I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
+As she wheeled her wheel-barrow
+Through streets broad and narrow
+Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-O!
+Alive, alive-O! alive, alive-O!
+She was a fish-monger, but sure twas no wonder
+For so were her father and mother before
+And they each wheeled their barrow
+She died of a fever, and no one could save her
+And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
+But her ghost wheels her barrow
+The Garden of Eden has vanished, they say
+But I know the lie of it still;
+Just turn to the left at the bridge of Finea
+And stop when halfway to Cootehill.
+Tis there I will find it,
+I know sure enough
+When fortune has come to me call,
+Oh the grass it is green around Ballyjamesduff
+And the blue sky is over it all.
+And tones that are tender and tones that are gruff
+Are whispering over the sea,
+Come back, Paddy Reilly to Ballyjamesduff
+Come home, Paddy Reilly, to me.
+My mother once told me that when I was born
+The day that I first saw the light,
+I looked down the street on that very first morn
+And gave a great crow of delight.
+Now most newborn babies appear in a huff,
+And start with a sorrowful squall,
+But I knew I was born in Ballyjamesduff
+And thats why I smiled on them all.
+The babys a man, now hes toil-worn and tough
+Still, whispers come over the sea,
+The night that we danced by the light of the moon,
+Wid Phil to the fore wid his flute,
+When Phil threw his lip over Come Again Soon,
+Hes dance the foot out o yer boot!
+The day that I took long Magee by the scruff
+For slanderin Rosie Kilrain,
+Then, marchin him straight out of Ballyjamesduff,
+Assisted him into a drain.
+Oh, sweet are the dreams, as the dudeen I puff,
+Of whisperings over the sea,
+Ive loved the young women of every land,
+That always came easy to me;
+Just barrin the belles of the Black-a-moor brand
+And the chocolate shapes of Feegee.
+But that sort of love is a moonshiny stuff,
+And never will addle me brain,
+For the bells will be ringin in Ballyjamesduff
+For me and me Rosie Kilrain!
+And through all their glamour, their gas and their guff
+A whisper comes over the sea,
+Ive struck oil at last!
+Ive struck work, and I vow
+Ive struck some remarkable clothes,
+Ive struck a policeman for sayin that now,
+Id go back to my beautiful Rose.
+The belles they may blarney,
+the boys they may bluff
+But this I will always maintain,
+No place in the world like Ballyjamesduff
+No guril (sic) like Rosie Kilrain.
+Ive paid for my passage, the sea may be rough
+But borne on each breeze there will be,
+Will you come to the bower oer the free boundless ocean
+Where the stupendous waves roll in thundering motion,
+Where the mermaids are seen and the fierce tempest gathers,
+To loved Erin the green, the dear land of our fathers.
+Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower?
+Will you come to the land of ONeill and ODonnell
+Of Lord Lucan of old and immortal OConnell.
+Where Brian drove the Danes and Saint Patrick the vermin
+And whose valleys remain still most beautiful and charming?
+You can visit Benburb and the storied Blackwater,
+Where Owen Roe met Munroe and his Chieftains did slaughter
+Where the lambs skip and play on the mossy all over,
+From those bright golden views to enchanting Rostrevor.
+You can see Dublin city, and the fine groves of Blarney
+The Bann, Boyne, and Liffey and the Lakes of Killarney,
+You may ride on the tide on the broad majestic Shannon
+You may sail round Loch Neagh and see storied Dungannon.
+You can visit New Ross, gallant Wexford, and Gorey,
+Where the green was last seen by proud Saxon and Tory,
+Where the soil is sanctified by the blood of each true man
+Where they died satisfied that their enemies they would not run from.
+Will you come and awake our lost land from its slumber
+And her fetters well break, links that long are encumbered.
+And the air will resound with hosannahs to greet you
+On the shore will be found gallant Irishmen to greet you.
+Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
+From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
+The summers gone, and all the flowers are dying
+Tis you, tis you must go and I must bide.
+But come ye back when summers in the meadow
+Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow
+Tis Ill be here in sunshine or in shadow
+Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.
+And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
+And I am dead, as dead I well may be
+Youll come and find the place where I am lying
+And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
+And I shall hear, tho soft you tread above me
+And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
+If youll not fail to tell me that you love me
+Ill simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
+I found my love by the gasworks croft
+Dreamed a dream by the old canal
+Kissed my girl by the factory wall
+Dirty old town, dirty old town.
+Clouds are drifting across the moon
+Cats are prowling on their beat
+Springs a girl in the street at night
+I heard a siren from the docks
+Saw a train set the night on fire
+Smelled the spring in the smokey wind
+Im going to make a good sharp axe
+Shining steel tempered in the fire
+Well chop you down like an old dead tree
+t was down by the Salley Gardens, my love and I did meet.
+She crossed the Salley Gardens with little snow-white feet.
+She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree,
+But I was young and foolish, and with her did not agree.
+In a field down by the river, my love and I did stand
+And on my leaning shoulder, she laid her snow-white hand.
+She bid me take life easy , as the grass grows on the weirs
+But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears.
+Down by the Salley Gardens, my love and I did meet.
+When, like the dawning day
+Eileen Aroon
+Love sends his early ray
+Eileen Aroon.
+What makes his dawning glow
+Changeless through joy and woe
+Only the constant know
+Were she no longer true
+What would her lover do
+Fly with a broken chain
+Far oer the bounding main
+Never to love again
+Youth must in time decay
+Beauty must fade away
+Castles are sacked in war
+Chieftains are scattered far
+Truth is a fixed star
+Believe me, if all those endearing young charms
+Which I gaze on so fondly today
+Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms
+Like fairy gifts fading away.
+Thou wouldst still be adored as this moment thou art
+Let thy loveliness fade as it will
+And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
+Would entwine itself verdantly still.
+It is not while beauty and youth are thine own
+And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear
+That the fervor and faith of a soul can be known
+To which time will but make thee more dear.
+No, the heart that has truly loved never forgets
+But as truly loves on to the close
+As the sunflower turns to her God when he sets
+The same look which she turned when she rose.
+Ill tell you a story of a row in the town,
+When the green flag went up and the Crown rag came down,
+Twas the neatest and sweetest thing ever you saw,
+And they played the best games played in Erin Go Bragh.
+One of our comrades was down at Rings end,
+For the honor of Ireland to hold and defend,
+He had no veteran soldiers but volunteers raw,
+Playing sweet Mauser music for Erin Go Bragh.
+Now heres to Pat Pearse and our comrades who died
+Tom Clark, MacDonagh, MacDiarmada, McBryde,
+And heres to James Connolly who gave one hurrah,
+And placed the machine guns for Erin Go Bragh.
+One brave English captain was ranting that day,
+Saying, Give me one hour and Ill blow you away,
+But a big Mauser bullet got stuck in his craw,
+And he died of lead poisoning in Erin Go Bragh.
+Old Ceannt and his comrades like lions at bay,
+From the South Dublin Union poured death and dismay,
+And what was their horror when the Englishmen saw
+All the dead khaki soldiers in Erin Go Bragh.
+Now heres to old Dublin, and heres her renown,
+In the long generation her fame will go down,
+And our children will tell how their forefathers saw,
+The red blaze of freedom in Erin Go Bragh.
+Of priests we can offer a charmin variety,
+Far renownd for learnin and piety;
+Still, Id advance ye widout impropriety,
+Father OFlynn as the flowr of them all.
+cho: Heres a health to you, Father OFlynn,
+Slainte and slainte and slainte agin;
+Powrfulest preacher, and tenderest teacher,
+And kindliest creature in ould Donegal.
+Dont talk of your Provost and Fellows of Trinity,
+Famous forever at Greek and Latinity,
+Dad and the divils and all at Divinity
+Father OFlynn d make hares of them all!
+Come, I venture to give ye my word,
+Never the likes of his logic was heard,
+Down from mythology into thayology,
+Truth! and conchology if hed the call.
+Och Father OFlynn, youve a wonderful way wid you,
+All ould sinners are wishful to pray wid you,
+All the young childer are wild for to play wid you,
+Youve such a way wid you, Father avick.
+Still for all youve so gentle a soul,
+Gad, youve your flock in the grandest control,
+Checking the crazy ones, coaxin onaisy ones,
+Lifting the lazy ones on wid the stick.
+And tho quite avoidin all foolish frivolity;
+Still at all seasons of innocent jollity,
+Where was the playboy could claim an equality,
+At comicality, Father, wid you?
+Once the Bishop looked grave at your jest,
+Till this remark set him off wid the rest:
+Is it lave gaiety all to the laity?
+Cannot the clergy be Irishmen, too?
+What did I have, said the fine old woman
+What did I have, this proud old woman did say
+I had four green fields, each one was a jewel
+But strangers came and tried to take them from me
+I had fine strong sons, who fought to save my jewels
+They fought and they died, and that was my grief said she
+Long time ago, said the fine old woman
+Long time ago, this proud old woman did say
+There was war and death, plundering and pillage
+My children starved, by mountain, valley and sea
+And their wailing cries, they shook the very heavens
+My four green fields ran red with their blood, said she
+What have I now, said the fine old woman
+What have I now, this proud old woman did say
+I have four green fields, one of thems in bondage
+In strangers hands, that tried to take it from me
+But my sons had sons, as brave as were their fathers
+My fourth green field will bloom once again said she
+Just give me your hand,
+Tabhair dom do lÃ¡mh.
+Just give me your hand
+And Ill walk with you,
+Through the streets of our land,
+Through the mountains so grand.
+If you give me your hand.
+And come along with me.
+Will you give me your hand,
+And the world it can see,
+That we can be free,
+In peace and harmony?
+From the north to the south.
+From the east to the west.
+Every mountain, every valley,
+Every bush and birds nest!
+For the world it is ours.
+All the sea and the land,
+To destroy or command,
+In a gesture of peace.
+Will you give me your hand
+And all troubles will cease,
+For the strong and the weak,
+For the rich and the poor?
+All peoples and creeds,
+Lets meet their needs.
+With a passion, we can fashion,
+A new world of love!
+By day and night,
+Through all struggle and strife,
+And beside you, to guide you,
+Forever, my love.
+For loves not for one,
+But for both of us to share.
+For our country so fair,
+For our world and whats there.
+Green grow the lilacs, all sparkling with dew
+Im lonely, my darling, since parting with you;
+But by our next meeting IUll hope to prove true
+And change the green lilacs to the Red, White and Blue.
+I once had a sweetheart, but now I have none
+Shes gone and shes left me, I care not for one
+Since shes gone and left me, contented Ill be,
+For she loves another one better than me.
+I passed my loves window, both early and late
+The look that she gave me, it makes my heart ache;
+Oh, the look that she gave me was painful to see,
+I wrote my love letters in rosy red lines,
+She sent me an answer all twisted and twined;
+Saying,Keep your love letters and I will keep mine
+Just you write to your love and Ill write to mine.
+Oh Haste to the Wedding, the pipes, the pipes are calling
+Oh Haste to the Wedding, oh Haste to the Wedding, I love you so.
+Ill take you home again, Kathleen
+Across the ocean wild and wide
+To where your heart has ever been
+Since you were first my bonnie bride.
+The roses all have left your cheek.
+Ive watched them fade away and die
+Your voice is sad when eer you speak
+And tears bedim your loving eyes.
+Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen
+To where your heart will feel no pain
+And when the fields are fresh and green
+Ill take you to your home again!
+I know you love me, Kathleen, dear
+Your heart was ever fond and true.
+I always feel when you are near
+That life holds nothing, dear, but you.
+The smiles that once you gave to me
+I scarcely ever see them now
+Though many, many times I see
+A darkning shadow on your brow.
+To that dear home beyond the sea
+My Kathleen shall again return.
+And when thy old friends welcome thee
+Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
+Where laughs the little silver stream
+Beside your mothers humble cot
+And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
+There all your grief will be forgot.
+Ill tell my ma when I go home
+The boys wont leave the girls alone
+They pulled my hair, they stole my comb
+But thats all right till I go home.
+She is handsome, she is pretty
+She is the bell of Belfast city
+She is counting one, two, three
+Please wont you tell me who is she.
+Albert Mooney says he loves her
+All the boys are fighting for her
+They knock at the door and they ring at the bell
+Sayin Oh my true love, are you well?
+Out she comes as white as snow
+Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
+Old John Murray says shell die
+If she doesnt get the fellow with the roving eye.
+Let the wind and rain and the hail blow high
+And the snow come tumblin from the sky
+Shes as nice as apple pie
+Shell get her own lad by and by.
+When she gets a lad of her own
+She wont tell her ma when she goes home
+Let them all come as they will
+For its Albert Mooney she loves still.
+While goin the road to sweet Athy, 
+hurroo, hurroo
+While goin the road to sweet Athy
+A stick in me hand and a drop in me eye
+A doleful damsel I heard cry,
+Johnny I hardly knew ye.
+With your drums and guns and drums and guns
+The enemy nearly slew ye
+Oh my darling dear, Ye look so queer
+Where are your eyes that were so mild
+When my heart you so beguiled
+Why did ye run from me and the child
+Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
+Where are your legs that used to run
+When you went for to carry a gun
+Indeed your dancing days are done
+Im happy for to see ye home
+All from the island of Sulloon
+So low in flesh, so high in bone
+Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.
+Ye havent an arm, ye havent a leg
+Yere an armless, boneless, chickenless egg
+Yell have to put with a bowl out to beg
+Theyre rolling out the guns again
+But they never will take our sons again
+No they never will take our sons again
+Johnny Im swearing to ye.
+As I was a-walkin round Kilgary Mountain
+I met with Captain Pepper as his money he was countin
+I rattled my pistols and I drew forth my saber
+Sayin, Stand and deliver, for I am the bold deceiver.
+Musha rig um du rum da
+Whack fol the daddy o
+Theres whiskey in the jar.
+The shinin golden coins did look so bright and jolly
+I took em with me home and I gave em to my Molly
+She promised and she vowed that she never would deceive me
+But the devils in the women and they never can be easy.
+When I was awakened between six and seven
+The guards were all around me in numbers odd and even
+I flew to my pistols, but alas I was mistaken
+For Mollys drawn my pistols and a prisoner I was taken.
+They put me into jail without judge or writin
+For robbing Colonel Pepper on Kilgary Mountain
+But they didnt take my fists so I knocked the sentry down
+And bid a fond farewell to the jail in Sligo town.
+Now some take delight in fishin and in bowlin
+And others take delight in carriages a-rollin
+But I take delight in the juice of the barley
+And courtin pretty girls in the morning so early.
+Oer railroad ties and crossings
+I made my weary way,
+Through swamps and elevations
+My tired feet did stray
+Until I resolved at sunset
+Some higher ground to win.
+Twas there I met with a Creole girl
+By the lake of Ponchartrain.
+Good evening, fair maiden,
+My money does me no good.
+If it want for the allegators
+Id stay out in the wood.
+Youre welcome, welcome, stranger.
+At home it is quite plain
+For we never turn a stranger
+From the lake of Ponchartrain.
+She took me to her mothers home
+And she treated me quite well;
+Her long black hair in ringlets
+Upon her shoulders fell.
+I tried to paint her picture
+But, alas, it was in vain
+So handsome was that Creole girl
+I asked her if shed marry me
+She said that neer could be;
+She said she had a lover,
+And he was on the sea,
+She said she had a lover
+It was true she would remain,
+Until he returned for the Creole girl
+Adieu, adieu, fair maiden,
+You neer shall see me more
+And when you are thinking of the old times
+And the cottage by the shore
+And when I meet a sociable
+With a glass of the foaming main
+Ill drink good health to the Creole girl
+n the town of Athy one Jeremy Lanigan
+Battered away til he hadnt a pound.
+His father died and made him a man again
+Left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
+He gave a grand party for friends and relations
+Who didnt forget him when come to the wall,
+And if youll but listen Ill make your eyes glisten
+Of the rows and the ructions of Lanigans Ball.
+Myself to be sure got free invitation,
+For all the nice girls and boys I might ask,
+And just in a minute both friends and relations
+Were dancing round merry as bees round a cask.
+Judy ODaly, that nice little milliner,
+She tipped me a wink for to give her a call,
+And I soon arrived with Peggy McGilligan
+Just in time for Lanigans Ball.
+There were lashings of punch and wine for the ladies,
+Potatoes and cakes; there was bacon and tea,
+There were the Nolans, Dolans, OGradys
+Courting the girls and dancing away.
+Songs they went round as plenty as water,
+The harp that once sounded in Taras old hall,
+Sweet Nelly Gray and The Rat Catchers Daughter,
+All singing together at Lanigans Ball.
+They were doing all kinds of nonsensical polkas
+All round the room in a whirligig.
+Julia and I, we banished their nonsense
+And tipped them the twist of a reel and a jig.
+&Och mavrone, how the girls got all mad at me
+Danced til youd think the ceiling would fall.
+For I spent three weeks at Brooks Academy
+Learning new steps for Lanigans Ball.
+Three long weeks I spent up in Dublin,
+Three long weeks to learn nothing at all,
+She stepped out and I stepped in again,
+I stepped out and she stepped in again,
+Boys were all merry and the girls they were hearty
+And danced all around in couples and groups,
+Til an accident happened, young Terrance McCarthy
+Put his right leg through miss Finnertys hoops.
+Poor creature fainted and cried: Meelia murther,
+Called for her brothers and gathered them all.
+Carmody swore that hed go no further
+Til he had satisfaction at Lanigans Ball.
+In the midst of the row miss Kerrigan fainted,
+Her cheeks at the same time as red as a rose.
+Some of the lads declared she was painted,
+She took a small drop too much, I suppose.
+Her sweetheart, Ned Morgan, so powerful and able,
+When he saw his fair colleen stretched out by the wall,
+Tore the left leg from under the table
+And smashed all the Chaneys at Lanigans Ball.
+Boys, oh boys, twas then there were runctions.
+Myself got a lick from big Phelim McHugh.
+I soon replied to his introduction
+And kicked up a terrible hullabaloo.
+Old Casey, the piper, was near being strangled.
+They squeezed up his pipes, bellows, chanters and all.
+The girls, in their ribbons, they got all entangled
+And that put an end to Lanigans Ball.
+Step we gaily, on we go
+Heel for heel and toe for toe,
+Arm in arm and row on row
+All for Mairis wedding.
+Over hillways up and down
+Myrtle green and bracken brown,
+Past the sheilings through the town
+All for sake of Mairi.
+Red her cheeks as rowans are
+Bright her eyes as any star,
+Fairest o them all by far
+Is our darlin Mairi.
+Plenty herring, plenty meal
+Plenty peat to fill her creel,
+Plenty bonny bairns as weel
+Thats the toast for Mairi.
+I have seen the lark soar high at morn
+Heard his song up in the blue
+I have heard the blackbird pipe his note
+The thrush and the linnet too
+But theres none of them can sing so sweet
+My singing bird as you.
+If I could lure my singing bird
+From his own cozy nest
+If I could catch my singing bird
+I would warm him on my breast
+For theres none of them can sing so sweet
+Of all the money that eer I spent
+Ive spent it in good company
+And all the harm that ever I did
+Alas it was to none but me
+And all Ive done for want of wit
+To memory now I cant recall
+So fill to me the parting glass
+Good night and joy be with you all
+If I had money enough to spend
+And leisure to sit awhile
+There is a fair maid in the town
+That sorely has my heart beguiled
+Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
+I own she has my heart enthralled
+Oh, all the comrades that eer I had
+Theyre sorry for my going away
+And all the sweethearts that eer I had
+Theyd wish me one more day to stay
+But since it falls unto my lot
+That I should rise and you should not
+Ill gently rise and softly call
+It was on a fine summers morning,
+When the birds sweetly tuned on each bough;
+I heard a fair maid sing most charming
+As she sat a-milking her cow;
+Her voice, it was chanting melodious,
+She left me scarce able to go;
+My heart it is soothed in solace,
+My CailÃ­n deas crÃºite na mbÃ³.
+With courtesy I did salute her,
+Good-morrow, most amiable maid,
+Im your captive slave for the future.
+Kind sir, do not banter, she said,
+Im not such a precious rare jewel,
+That I should enamour you so;
+I am but a plain country girl,
+Says CailÃ­n deas crÃºite na mbÃ³.
+The Indies afford no such jewel,
+So precious and transparently fair,
+Oh! do not to my flame add fuel,
+But consent for to love me, my dear;
+Take pity and grant my desire,
+And leave me no longer in woe;
+Oh! love me or else Ill expire,
+Sweet CailÃ­n deas crÃºite na mbÃ³.
+Or had I the wealth of great Damer,
+Or all on the African shore,
+Or had I great Devonshire treasure,
+Or had I ten thousand times more,
+Or had I the lamp of Alladin,
+Or had I his genie also,
+Id rather live poor on a mountain,
+With CailÃ­n deas crÃºite na mbÃ³.
+I beg youll withdraw and dont tease me;
+I cannot consent unto thee.
+I like to live single and airy,
+Till more of the world I do see.
+New cares they would me embarrass,
+Besides, sir, my fortune is low,
+Until I get rich Ill not marry,
+An old maid is like an old almanack,
+Quite useless when once out of date;
+If her ware is not sold in the morning
+At noon it must fall to low rate.
+The fragrance of May is soon over,
+The rose loses its beauty, you know;
+All bloom is consumed in October,
+A young maid is like a ship sailing,
+Theres no knowing how long she may steer,
+For with every blast shes in danger;
+Oh! consent, love, and banish all care.
+For riches I care not a farthing,
+Your affection I want and no more;
+In comfort Id wish to enjoy you,
+Red is the rose that in yonder garden grows
+Fair is the lily of the valley
+Clear is the water that flows from the Boyne
+But my love is fairer than any.
+Come over the hills, my bonnie Irish lass
+Come over the hills to your darling
+You choose the rose, love, and Ill make the vow
+And Ill be your true love forever.
+Twas down by Killarneys green woods that we strayed
+When the moon and the stars they were shining
+The moon shone its rays on her locks of golden hair
+And she swore shed be my love forever.
+Its not for the parting that my sister pains
+Its not for the grief of my mother
+Tis all for the loss of my bonny Irish lass
+That my heart is breaking forever.
+In the merry month of June from me home I started,
+Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,
+Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
+Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
+Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
+Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
+Bought a pair of brogues rattling oer the bogs
+And frightning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.
+One, two, three four, five, Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky
+road and all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !
+In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary, Started by daylight
+next morning blithe and early, Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
+Thats a Paddys cure whenever hes on drinking. See the lassies smile, laughing
+all the while At me curious style, twould set your heart a bubblin
+Asked me was I hired, wages I required, I was almost tired of the
+rocky road to Dublin.
+In Dublin next arrived, I thought it be a pity
+To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
+So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
+Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
+Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
+No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin
+Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
+Wasnt much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.
+From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
+Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
+The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
+When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
+Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
+Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
+When off Holyhead wished meself was dead,
+Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.
+Well the bouys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
+Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
+Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
+Poor old Erins Isle they began abusing.
+Hurrah me soul says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
+Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in,
+With a load hurray ! joined in the affray.
+We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.
+road and all the way to Dublin, Whack fol all the Ra !
+O see the fleet-foot host of men, who march with faces drawn,
+From farmstead and from fishers cot, along the banks of Ban;
+They come with vengeance in their eyes. Too late! Too late are they,
+For young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
+Oh Ireland, Mother Ireland, you love them still the best
+The fearless brave who fighting fall upon your hapless breast,
+But never a one of all your dead more bravely fell in fray,
+Than he who marches to his fate on the bridge of Toome today.
+Up the narrow street he stepped, so smiling, proud and young.
+About the hemp-rope on his neck, the golden ringlets clung;
+Theres neer a tear in his blue eyes, fearless and brave are they,
+As young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
+When last this narrow street he trod, his shining pike in hand
+Behind him marched, in grim array, a earnest stalwart band.
+To Antrim town! To Antrim town, he led them to the fray,
+But young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
+The grey coat and its sash of green were brave and stainless then,
+A banner flashed beneath the sun over the marching men;
+The coat hath many a rent this noon, the sash is torn away,
+And Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
+Oh, how his pike flashed in the sun! Then found a foemans heart,
+Through furious fight, and heavy odds he bore a true mans part
+And many a red-coat bit the dust before his keen pike-play,
+But Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
+Theres never a one of all your dead more bravely died in fray
+Than he who marches to his fate in Toomebridge town today;
+True to the last! True to the last, he treads the upwards way,
+And young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
+Ive traveled all over this world
+And now to another I go
+And I know that good quarters are waiting
+To welcome old Rosin the Bow
+To welcome old Rosin the Bow.
+When Im dead and laid out on the counter
+A voice you will hear from below
+Saying Send down a hogshead of whiskey
+To drink with old Rosin the Bow
+To drink with old Rosin the Bow.
+Then get a half dozen stout fellows
+And stack them all up in a row
+Let them drink out of half gallon bottles
+To the memory of Rosin the Bow
+To the memory of Rosin the Bow.
+Then get this half dozen stout fellows
+And let them all stagger and go
+And dig a great hole in the meadow
+And in it put Rosin the Bow
+And in it put Rosin the Bow.
+Then get ye a couple of bottles
+Put one at me head and me toe
+With a diamond ring scratch upon them
+The name of old Rosin the Bow
+The name of old Rosin the Bow.
+Ive only this one consolation
+As out of this world I go
+I know that the next generation
+Will resemble old Rosin the Bow
+Will resemble old Rosin the Bow.
+I fear that old tyrant approaching
+That cruel remorseless old foe
+And I lift up me glass in his honor
+Take a drink with old Rosin the Bow
+Take a drink with old Rosin the Bow.
+He was stranded in a tiny town on fair Prince Edward Isle
+Waiting for a ship to come and find him
+A one horse place, a friendly face, some coffee and a tiny trace
+Of fiddlin in the distance far behind him
+A dime across the counter then, a shy hello, a brand new friend
+A walk along the street in the wintry weather
+A yellow light, an open door, and a Welcome friend, theres room for more
+And then theyre standing there inside together
+He said, Ive heard that tune before somewhere but I cant remember when,
+Was it on some other friendly shore, did I hear it on the wind
+Was it written on the sky above, I think I heard it from someone I love
+But I never heard a sound so sweet since then
+And now his feet begin to tap, a little boy says, Ill take your hat.
+Hes caught up in the magic of her smile
+Leap, the heart inside him went, and off across the floor he sent
+His clumsy body, graceful as a child
+He said, Theres magic in the fiddlers arms and theres magic in this town
+Theres magic in the dancers feet and the way they put them down
+People smiling everywhere, boots and ribbons, locks of hair
+Laughtcr, old blue suits and Easter gowns
+The sailors gone, the room is bare, the old pianos setting there
+Someones hats left hanging on the rack
+The empty chair, the wooden floor that feels the touch of shoes no more
+Awaitin for the dancers to come back
+And thc fiddles in the closet of some daughter of the town
+The strings are broke, tbe bow is gone and the covers buttoned down
+But sometimes on December nights, when the air is cold and the wind is right
+Theres a melody that passes through the town.
+My young love said to me, My mother wont mind
+And my father wont slight you for your lack of kind.
+And she stepped away from me and this she did say
+It will not be long, love, till our wedding day.
+As she stepped away from me and she moved through the fair
+And fondly I watched her move here and move there
+And then she turned homeward with one star awake
+Like the swan in the evening moves over the lake.
+The people were saying, no two eer were wed
+But one had a sorrow that never was said
+And I smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear
+And that was the last that I saw of my dear.
+Last night she came to me, my dead love came in
+So softly she came that her feet made no din
+As she laid her hand on me and this she did say:
+It will not be long, love, til our wedding day.
+Oh father dear, I oft-times hear you speak of Erins isle
+Her lofty hills, her valleys green, her mountains rude and wild
+They say she is a lovely land wherein a saint might dwell
+So why did you abandon her, the reason to me tell.
+Oh son, I loved my native land with energy and pride
+Till a blight came oer the praties; my sheep, my cattle died
+My rent and taxes went unpaid, I could not them redeem
+And thats the cruel reason why I left old Skibbereen.
+Oh well do I remember that bleak December day
+The landlord and the sheriff came to take us all away
+They set my roof on fire with their cursed English spleen
+I heaved a sigh and bade goodbye to dear old Skibbereen.
+Your mother too, God rest her soul, fell on the stony ground
+She fainted in her anguish seeing desolation round
+She never rose but passed away from life to immortal dream
+She found a quiet grave, me boy, in dear old Skibbereen.
+And you were only two years old and feeble was your frame
+I could not leave you with my friends for you bore your fathers name
+I wrapped you in my cï¿½ta mï¿½r in the dead of night unseen
+Oh father dear, the day will come when in answer to the call
+All Irish men of freedom stern will rally one and all
+Ill be the man to lead the band beneath the flag of green
+And loud and clear well raise the cheer, Revenge for Skibbereen!
+Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
+Naught be all else to me save that thou art
+Thou my best thought by day or by night
+Waking or sleeping thy presence my light.
+Be thou my wisdom, thou my true word
+I ever with thee, thou with me, Lord
+Thou my great Father, I thy true Son
+Thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.
+Be thou my battleshield, sword for the fight
+Be thou my dignity, thou my delight
+Thou my souls shelter, thou my high tower
+Raise thou me heavenward, O power of my power.
+Riches I heed not, nor mans empty praise
+Thou mine inheritance, now and always
+Thou and thou only, first in my heart
+High King of heavem, my treasure thou art.
+High King of heaven, after victory won
+May I reach heavens joys, O bright heavens sun
+Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
+Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
+Last night as I lay dreaming of pleasant days gone by
+My mind being bent on rambling to Ireland I did fly
+I stepped on board a vision and I followed with the wind
+And I shortly came to anchor at the cross of Spancil Hill
+It being the 23rd June the day before the fair
+When lrelands sons and daughters in crowds assembled there
+The young and the old, the brave and the bold their journey to fulfill
+There were jovial conversations at the fair of Spancil Hill
+I went to see my neighbors to hear what they might say
+The old ones were all dead and gone and the young ones turning grey
+I met with the tailor Quigley, hes a bould as ever still
+Sure he used to make my britches when I lived in Spancil Hill
+I paid a flying visit to my first and only love
+Shes as white as any lily and as gentle as a dove
+She threw her arms around me saying Johnny I love you still
+Oh shes Ned the farmers daughter and the flower of Spancil HiII
+I dreamt I held and kissed her as in the days of yore
+She said, Johnny youre only joking like manys the time before
+The cock he crew in the morning he crew both loud and shrill
+And I awoke in California, many miles from Spancil Hill.
+Near Banbridge town, in the County Down
+One morning in July
+Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen
+And she smiled as she passed me by.
+She looked so sweet from her two white feet
+To the sheen of her nut-brown hair
+Such a coaxing elf, Id to shake myself
+To make sure I was standing there.
+From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay
+And from Galway to Dublin town
+No maid Ive seen like the sweet colleen
+That I met in the County Down.
+As she onward sped I shook my head
+And I gazed with a feeling rare
+And I said, says I, to a passerby
+Whos the maid with the nut-brown hair?
+He smiled at me, and with pride says he,
+Thats the gem of Irelands crown.
+Shes young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
+Shes the star of the County Down.
+Ive travelled a bit, but never was hit
+Since my roving career began
+But fair and square I surrendered there
+To the charms of young Rose McCann.
+Id a heart to let and no tenant yet
+Did I meet with in shawl or gown
+But in she went and I asked no rent
+From the star of the County Down.
+At the crossroads fair Ill be surely there
+And Ill dress in my Sunday clothes
+And Ill try sheeps eyes, and deludhering lies
+On the heart of the nut-brown rose.
+No pipe Ill smoke, no horse Ill yoke
+Though with rust my plow turns brown
+Till a smiling bride by my own fireside
+Sits the star of the County Down.
+It was early, early in the spring
+The birds did whistle and sweetly sing
+Changing their notes from tree to tree
+And the song they sang was Old Ireland free.
+It was early early in the night,
+The yeoman cavalry gave me a fright
+The yeoman cavalry was my downfall
+And I was taken by Lord Cornwall.
+Twas in the guard-house where I was laid,
+And in a parlour where I was tried
+My sentence passed and my courage low
+When to Dungannon I was forced to go.
+As I was passing my fathers door
+My brother William stood at the door
+My aged father stood at the door
+And my tender mother her hair she tore.
+As I was going up Wexford Street
+My own first cousin I chanced to meet;
+My own first cousin did me betray
+And for one bare guinea swore my life away.
+As I was walking up Wexford Hill
+Who could blame me to cry my fill?
+I looked behind, and I looked before
+But my aged mother I shall see no more.
+And as I mounted the platform high
+My aged father was standing by;
+My aged father did me deny
+And the name he gave me was the Croppy Boy.
+It was in Dungannon this young man died
+And in Dungannon his body lies.
+And you good people that do pass by
+Oh shed a tear for the Croppy Boy.
+One morning early I walked forth
+By the margin of Lough Leane
+The sunshine dressed the trees in green
+And summer bloomed again
+I left the town and wandered on
+Through fields all green and gay
+And whom should I meet but a colleen sweet
+At the dawning of the day.
+No cap or cloak this maiden wore
+Her neck and feet were bare
+Down to the grass in ringlets fell
+Her glossy golden hair
+A milking pail was in her hand
+She was lovely, young and gay
+She wore the palm from Venus bright
+By the dawning of the day.
+On a mossy bank I sat me down
+With the maiden by my side
+With gentle words I courted her
+And asked her to be my bride
+She said, Young man dont bring me blame
+And swiftly turned away
+And the morning light was shining bright
+By a lonely prison wall
+I heard a sweet voice calling,
+Danny, they have taken you away.
+For you stole Travelians corn,
+That your babes might see the morn,
+Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay.
+Fair lie the fields of Athenry
+Where once we watched the small freebirds fly.
+Our love grew with the spring,
+We had dreams and songs to sing
+As we wandered through the fields of Athenry.
+I heard a young man calling
+Nothing matters, Jenny, when youre free
+Against the famine and the crown,
+I rebelled, they ran me down,
+Now you must raise our children without me.
+On the windswept harbour wall,
+She watched the last star rising
+As the prison ship sailed out across the sky
+But shell watch and hope and pray,
+For her love in Botany Bay
+Whilst she is lonely in the fields of Athenry.
+Oh, a wan cloud was drawn oer the dim weeping dawn
+As to Shannons side I returnd at last
+And the heart in my breast for the girl I lovd best
+Was beating, ah, beating, loud and fast!
+While the doubts and the fears of the long aching years
+Seemd mingling their voices with the moaning flood
+Till full in my path, like a wild water wrath
+My true loves shadow lamenting stood.
+But the sudden sun kissd the cold, cruel mist
+Into dancing showrs of diamond dew
+And the dark flowing stream laughd back to his beam
+And the lark soared aloft in the blue
+While no phantom of night but a form of delight
+Ran with arms outspread to her darling boy
+And the girl I love best on my wild throbbing breast
+Hid her thousand treasures with cry of joy.
+Gather up the pots and the old tin cans
+The mash, the corn, the barley and the bran.
+Run like the devil from the excise man
+Keep the smoke from rising, Barney.
+Keep your eyes well peeled today
+The excise men are on their way
+Searching for the mountain tay
+In the hills of Connemara.
+Swinging to the left, swinging to the right
+The excise men will dance all night
+Drinkin up the tay till the broad daylight
+A gallon for the butcher and a quart for John
+And a bottle for poor old Father Tom
+Just to help the poor old dear along
+Stand your ground, for its too late
+The excise men are at the gate.
+Glory be to Paddy, but theyre drinkin it straight
+Im sitting on the stile, Mary, where we once sat side by side
+On a bright May morning long ago, when first you were my bride
+The corn was springing fresh and green, and the lark sang loud and high
+And the red was on your lips, Mary, and the love light in your eyes.
+Tis but a step down yonder lane, the village Church stands near
+The place where we were wed, Mary, I can see the spire from here
+But the graveyard lies between, Mary, and my step might break your rest
+Where I laid you darling down to sleep with a baby on your breast.
+Im very lonely now, Mary, for the poor make no new friends
+But oh they love the better still the few our Father sends
+For you were all I had, Mary, my blessing and my pride
+And Ive nothing left to care for now since my poor Mary died.
+Yours was the good brave heart, Mary, that still kept hoping on
+When the trust in God had left my soul and my arms young strength had gone
+There was comfort ever on your lip and a kind look on your brow
+And I thank you Mary for the same though you cannot hear me now.
+Im bidding you a long farewell, my Mary kind and true
+But Ill not forget you, darling, in the land Im going to
+They say theres bread and work for all, and the sun shines always there
+But Ill neer forget old Ireland, were it fifty times as fair.
+And often in those grand old woods Ill sit and shut my eyes
+And my heart will wander back again to the place where Mary lies
+And I think Ill see that little stile where we sat side by side
+In the springing corn and the bright May morn when first you were my bride.
+When I was at home I was merry and frisky,
+My dad kept a pig and my mother sold whisky,
+My uncle was rich, but never would by aisey
+Till I was enlisted by Corporal Casey.
+Och! rub a dub, row de dow, Corporal Casey,
+My dear little Shelah, I thought would run crazy,
+When I trudged away with tough Corporal Casey.
+I marched from Kilkenny, and, as I was thinking
+On Shelah, my heart in my bosom was sinking,
+But soon I was forced to look fresh as a daisy,
+For fear of a drubbing from Corporal Casey.
+Och! rub a dub, row de dow, Corporal Casey!
+The devil go with him, I neer could be lazy,
+He struck my shirts so, ould Corporal Casey.
+We went into battle, I took the blows fairly
+That fell on my pate, but they bothered me rarely,
+And who should the first be that dropped, why, and please ye,
+It was my good friend, honest Corporal Casey.
+Thinks I you are quiet, and I shall be aisey,
+So eight years I fought without Corporal Casey.
+I am a little beggarman, a begging I have been
+For three score years in this little isle of green
+Im known along the Liffey from the Basin to the Zoo
+And everybody calls me by the name of Johnny Dhu.
+Of all the trades a going, sure the begging is the best
+For when a man is tired he can sit him down and rest
+He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
+But to slip around the corner with his old rigadoo.
+I slept in a barn one night in Currabawn
+A shocking wet night it was, but I slept until the dawn
+There was holes in the roof and the raindrops coming thru
+And the rats and the cats were a playing peek a boo.
+Who did I waken but the woman of the house
+With her white spotted apron and her calico blouse
+She began to frighten and I said boo
+Sure, dont be afraid at all, its only Johnny Dhu.
+I met a little girl while a walkin out one day
+Good morrow little flaxen haired girl, I did say
+Good morrow little beggarman and how do you do
+With your rags and your tags and your auld rigadoo.
+Ill buy a pair of leggins and a collar and a tie
+And a nice young lady Ill go courting by and by
+Ill buy a pair of goggles and Ill color them with blue
+And an old fashioned lady I will make her too.
+So all along the high road with my bag upon my back
+Over the fields with my bulging heavy sack
+With holes in my shoes and my toes a peeping thru
+Singing, skin a ma rink a doodle with my auld rigadoo.
+O I must be going to bed for its getting late at night
+The fire is all raked and now tis out of light
+For now youve heard the story of my auld rigadoo
+So good and God be with you, from auld Johnny Dhu.
+Oh, the days of the Kerry dancing
+Oh, the ring of the pipers tune
+Oh, for one of those hours of gladness
+Gone, alas, like our youth, too soon!
+When the boys began to gather
+In the glen of a summers night
+And the Kerry pipers tuning
+Made us long with wild delight!
+Oh, to think of it
+Oh, to dream of it
+Fills my heart with tears!
+Was there ever a sweeter Colleen
+In the dance than Eily More
+Or a prouder lad than Thady
+As he boldly took the floor.
+Lads and lasses to your places
+Up the middle and down again
+Ah, the merry hearted laughter
+Ringing through the happy glen!
+Time goes on, and the happy years are dead
+And one by one the merry hearts are fled
+Silent now is the wild and lonely glen
+Where the bright glad laugh will echo neer again
+Only dreaming of days gone by in my heart I hear.
+Loving voices of old companions
+Stealing out of the past once more
+And the sound of the dear old music
+Soft and sweet as in days of yore.
+Dear thoughts are in my mind
+And my soul soars enchanted,
+As I hear the sweet lark sing
+In the clear air of the day.
+For a tender beaming smile
+To my hope has been granted,
+And tomorrow she shall hear
+All my fond heart would say.
+I shall tell her all my love,
+All my souls adoration,
+And I think she will hear
+And will not say me nay.
+It is this that gives my soul
+All its joyous elation,
+Its cold and raw, the north winds blow
+Black in the morning early
+When all the hills were covered with snow
+Oh then it was winter fairly.
+As I was riding oer the moor
+I met a farmers daughter
+Her cherry cheeks and coal-black hair
+They caused my heart to falter.
+I bowed my bonnet very low
+To let her know my meaning.
+She answered with a courteous smile
+Her looks they were engaging.
+Where are you bound my pretty maid
+Its now in the morning early?
+The answer that she gave to me
+Kind sir, to sell my barley.
+Now twenty guineas Ive in my purse
+And twenty more thats yearly.
+You need not go to the market town
+For Ill buy all your barley.
+If twenty guineas would gain the heart
+Of the maid I love so dearly
+All for to tarry with me one night
+And go home in the morning early.
+The very evening after
+It was my fortune for to meet
+The farmers only daughter.
+Although the weather being cold and raw
+With her I thought to parlay
+The answer that she gave to me:
+Kind sir, Ive sold my barley.
+The Minstrel Boy to the war is gone
+In the ranks of death you will find him
+His fathers sword he hath girded on
+And his wild harp slung behind him
+Land of Song! said the warrior bard
+Tho all the world betrays thee
+One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard
+One faithful harp shall praise thee!
+The Minstrel fell! But the foemans chain
+Could not bring that proud soul under
+The harp he lovd neer spoke again
+For he tore its chords asunder
+And said No chains shall sully thee
+Thou soul of love and bravry!
+Thy songs were made for the pure and free,
+They shall never sound in slavery!
+Oh Mary this Londons a wonderful sight
+With people here workin by day and by night
+They dont sow potatoes, nor barley, nor wheat
+But theres gangs of them diggin for gold in the street
+At least when I asked them thats what I was told
+So I just took a hand at this diggin for gold
+But for all that I found there I might as well be
+Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.
+I believe that when writin a wish you expressed
+As to how the fine ladies in London were dressed
+Well if youll believe me, when asked to a ball
+They dont wear no top to their dresses at all
+Oh Ive seen them meself and you could not in truth
+Say that if they were bound for a ball or a bath
+Dont be startin them fashions, now Mary McCree
+Theres beautiful girls here, oh never you mind
+With beautiful shapes nature never designed
+And lovely complexions all roses and cream
+But let me remark with regard to the same
+That if that those roses you venture to sip
+The colors might all come away on your lip
+So Ill wait for the wild rose thats waitin for me
+In the place where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea.
+Beauing, belling, dancing, drinking,
+Breaking windows, cursing, sinking
+Every raking, never thinking,
+Live the Rakes of Mallow,
+Spending faster than it comes,
+Beating waiters bailiffs, duns,
+Bacchus true begotten sons,
+Live the Rakes of Mallow.
+One time naught but claret drinking,
+Then like politicians, thinking
+To raise the sinking funds when sinking.
+When at home, with da-da dying,
+Still for mellow water crying,
+But, where theres good claret plying
+Live the Rakes of Mallow.  
+When at home with dadda dying,
+Still for Mallow-water crying,
+But where there is good claret plying
+Living short but merry lives,
+Going where the devil drives,
+Having sweethearts, but no wives,
+Racking tenants stewards teasing,
+Swiftly spending, slowly raising,
+Wishing to spend all their days in
+Raking as at Mallow.
+Then to end this raking life,
+They get sober, take a wife,
+Ever after live in strife,
+And wish again for Mallow.
+How sweet is to roam by the sunny Shure stream
+And hear the doves coo neath the morning sunbeam
+Where the thrush and the robin their sweet notes entwine
+On the banks of the Shure that flows down by Mooncoin.
+Flow on, lovely river, flow gently along
+By your waters so sweet sounds the larks merry song
+On your green banks I wander where first I did join
+With you, lovely Molly, the rose of Mooncoin.
+Oh Molly, dear Molly, it breaks my fond heart
+To know that we two forever must part
+Ill think of you Molly while sun and moon shine
+Then heres to the Shure with its valley so fair
+As oftimes we wandered in the cool morning air
+Where the roses are blooming and lilies entwine
+The pale moon was rising above the green mountain
+The sun was declining beneath the blue sea
+When I strayed with my love to the pure crystal fountain
+That stands in beautiful vale of Tralee.
+She was lovely and fair as the rose of the summer
+Yet, twas not her beauty alone that won me
+Oh no! Twas the the truth in her eye ever beaming
+That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee.
+The cool shades of evening their mantle were spreading
+And Mary all smiling was listening to me
+The moon through the valley her pale rays was shedding
+When I won the heart of the Rose of Tralee.
+Though lovely and fair as the rose of the summer
+Mellow the moonlight to shine is beginning
+Close by the window young Eileen is spinning
+Bent oer the fire her blind grandmother sitting
+Crooning and moaning and drowsily knitting.
+Merrily cheerily noiselessly whirring
+Spins the wheel, rings the wheel while the foots stirring
+Sprightly and lightly and merrily ringing
+Sounds the sweet voice of the young maiden singing.
+Eileen, a chara, I hear someone tapping
+Tis the ivy dear mother against the glass flapping
+Eileen, I surely hear somebody sighing
+Tis the sound mother dear of the autumn winds dying.
+Whats the noise I hear at the window I wonder?
+Tis the little birds chirping, the holly-bush under
+What makes you shoving and moving your stool on
+And singing all wrong the old song of the Coolin?
+Theres a form at the casement, the form of her true love
+And he whispers with face bent, Im waiting for you love
+Get up from the stool, through the lattice step lightly
+And well rove in the grove while the moons shining brightly.
+The maid shakes her head, on her lips lays her fingers
+Steps up from the stool, longs to go and yet lingers
+A frightened glance turns to her drowsy grandmother
+Puts her foot on the stool spins the wheel with the other
+Lazily, easily, now swings the wheel round
+Slowly and lowly is heard now the reels sound
+Noiseless and light to the lattice above her
+The maid steps, then leaps to the arms of her lover.
+Slower... and slower... and slower the wheel swings
+Lower... and lower... and lower the reel rings
+Ere the reel and the wheel stop their ringing and moving
+Through the grove the young lovers by moonlight are roving.
+As I roved out one morning
+Near the verdant braes of Skreen
+I put my back to the mossy tree
+To view the dew on the West Countrie
+The dew on the foreign strand.
+O sit ye down on the grass, he said
+On the dewy grass so green
+For the wee birds all have come and gone
+Since I my true love seen, he said
+Since I my true love seen.
+O Ill not sit on the grass, she said
+No lover Ill be of thine
+For I hear you love a Connaught maid
+And your hearts no longer mine, she said
+And your hearts no longer mine.
+O I will climb a high high tree
+And Ill rob a wild birds nest
+And back Ill bring what I find there
+To the arms that I love best, he said
+To the arms that I love best.
+The water is wide, I cannot get oer
+Neither have I wings to fly
+Give me a boat that can carry two
+And both shall row, my love and I
+A ship there is and she sails the sea
+Shes loaded deep as deep can be
+But not so deep as the love Im in
+I know not if I sink or swim
+I leaned my back against an oak
+Thinking it was a trusty tree
+But first it bent and then it broke
+So did my love prove false to me
+I reached my finger into some soft bush
+Thinking the fairest flower to find
+I pricked my finger to the bone
+And left the fairest flower behind
+Oh love be handsome and love be kind
+Gay as a jewel when first it is new
+But love grows old and waxes cold
+And fades away like the morning dew
+Must I go bound while you go free
+Must I love a man who doesnt love me
+Must I be born with so little art
+As to love a man wholl break my heart
+When cockle shells turn silver bells
+Then will my love come back to me
+When roses bloom in winters gloom
+Then will my love return to me
+O Paddy dear, and did ye hear the news thats goin round?
+The shamrock is by law forbid to grow on Irish ground!
+No more Saint Patricks Day well keep, his color cant be seen
+For theres a cruel law agin the Wearin o the Green.
+I met with Napper Tandy, and he took me by the hand
+And he said, Hows poor old Ireland, and how does she stand?
+Shes the most distressful country that ever yet was seen
+For theyre hanging men and women there for the Wearin o the Green.
+So if the color we must wear be Englands cruel red
+Let it remind us of the blood that Irishmen have shed
+And pull the shamrock from your hat, and throw it on the sod
+But never fear, twill take root there, though underfoot tis trod.
+When laws can stop the blades of grass from growin as they grow
+And when the leaves in summer-time their color dare not show
+Then I will change the color too I wear in my caubeen
+But till that day, please God, Ill stick to the Wearin o the Green.
+Ive been a wild rover for many a year
+And I spent all my money on whiskey and beer,
+And now Im returning with gold in great store
+And I never will play the wild rover no more.
+And its no, nay, never,
+No nay never no more,
+Will I play the wild rover
+No never no more.
+I went to an ale-house I used to frequent
+And I told the landlady my money was spent.
+I asked her for credit, she answered me nay
+Such a custom as yours I could have any day.
+I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
+And the landladys eyes opened wide with delight.
+She said I have whiskey and wines of the best
+And the words that I spoke sure were only in jest.
+Ill go home to my parents, confess what Ive done
+And Ill ask them to pardon their prodigal son.
+And if they caress (forgive) me as ofttimes before
+Sure I never will play the wild rover no more.
+Theres a tear in your eye,
+And Im wondering why,
+For it never should be there at all.
+With such powr in your smile,
+Sure a stone youd beguile,
+So theres never a teardrop should fall.
+When your sweet lilting laughters
+Like some fairy song,
+And your eyes twinkle bright as can be;
+You should laugh all the while
+And all other times smile,
+And now, smile a smile for me.
+When Irish eyes are smiling,
+Sure, tis like the morn in Spring.
+In the lilt of Irish laughter
+You can hear the angels sing.
+When Irish hearts are happy,
+All the world seems bright and gay.
+And when Irish eyes are smiling,
+Sure, they steal your heart away.
+For your smile is a part
+Of the love in your heart,
+And it makes even sunshine more bright.
+Like the linnets sweet song,
+Crooning all the day long,
+Comes your laughter and light.
+For the springtime of life
+Is the sweetest of all
+There is neer a real care or regret;
+And while springtime is ours
+Throughout all of youths hours,
+Let us smile each chance we get.
+As I was a-goin over Gilgarra Mountain
+I spied Colonel Farrell, and his money he was countin.
+First I drew my pistols and then I drew my rapier,
+Sayin Stand and deliver, for I am your bold receiver.
+Musha ringum duram da,
+Whack fol the daddy-o,
+He counted out his money and it made a pretty penny;
+I put it in my pocket to take home to darlin Jenny.
+She sighed and swore she loved me and never would deceive me,
+Bu the devil take the women, for they always lie so easy!
+Musha rungum duram da
+I went into me chamber all for to take a slumber,
+To dream of gold and girls, and of course it was no wonder:
+Me Jenny took me charges and she filled them up with water,
+Called on Colonel Farrell to get ready for the slaughter.
+Next mornin early, before I rose for travel,
+A-came a band of footmen and likewise Colonel Farrell.
+I goes to draw my pistol, for shed stole away my rapier,
+But a prisoner I was taken, I couldnt shoot the water.
+They put me into jail with a judge all a-writin:
+For robbin Colonel Farrell on Gilgarra Mountain.
+But they didnt take me fists and I knocked the jailer down
+And bid a farewell to this tight-fisted town.
+Musha ringum duram da
+Id like to find me brother, the one whos in the army;
+I dont know where hes stationed, be it Cork or in Killarney.
+Together wed go roamin oer the mountains of Kilkenny,
+And I swear hed treat me fairer than my darlin sportin Jenny!
+Theres some takes delight in the carriages and rollin,
+Some takes delight in the hurley or the bollin,
+But I takes delight in the juice of the barley,
+Courtin pretty maids in the mornin, o so early!
+Oh the summertime is coming
+And the trees are sweetly blooming
+And the wild mountain thyme
+Grows around the blooming heather
+Will ye go, Lassie go?
+And well all go together
+To pluck wild mountain thyme
+All around the blooming heather
+I will build my love a tower
+Near yon pure crystal fountain
+And on it I will build
+All the flowers of the mountain
+If my true love she were gone
+I would surely find another
+Where wild mountain thyme
+When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
+And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
+And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
+Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;
+How many loved your moments of glad grace,
+And loved your beauty with love false or true,
+But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
+And loved the sorrows of your changing face;
+And bending down beside the glowing bars,
+Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
+And paced upon the mountains overhead
+And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
+How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
+I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
+My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
+For the ends of being and ideal grace.
+I love thee to the level of every day's
+Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
+I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
+I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
+I love thee with the passion put to use
+In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
+I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
+With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
+Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
+I shall but love thee better after death.
+Beloved, my Beloved, when I think 
+That thou wast in the world a year ago, 
+What time I sate alone here in the snow 
+And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink 
+No moment at thy voice ... but, link by link, 
+Went counting all my chains, as if that so 
+They never could fall off at any blow 
+Struck by thy possible hand ... why, thus I drink 
+Of life's great cup of wonder! Wonderful, 
+Never to feel thee thrill the day or night 
+With personal act or speech,—nor ever cull 
+Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white 
+Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull, 
+Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight.
+My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!
+And yet they seem alive and quivering
+Against my tremulous hands which loose the string
+And let them drop down on my knee tonight.
+This said—he wished to have me in his sight
+Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring
+To come and touch my hand. . . a simple thing,
+Yes I wept for it—this . . . the paper's light. . .
+Said, Dear, I love thee; and I sank and quailed
+As if God's future thundered on my past.
+This said, I am thine—and so its ink has paled
+With lying at my heart that beat too fast.
+And this . . . 0 Love, thy words have ill availed
+If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!
+Dearest creature in creation, Study English pronunciation.
+I will teach you in my verse Sounds like corpse, corps,
+ horse, and worse. I will keep you, Suzy, busy, 
+Make your head with heat grow dizzy. Tear in eye,
+ your dress will tear. So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.
+ Just compare heart, beard, and heard, Dies and diet,
+lord and word, Sword and sward, retain and Britain.
+(Mind the latter, how it's written.) Now I surely will
+not plague you With such words as plaque and ague.
+But be careful how you speak: Say break and steak,
+but bleak and streak; Cloven, oven, how and low,
+Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe. Hear me say,
+devoid of trickery, Daughter, laughter, and 
+Terpsichore, Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,
+Exiles, similes, and reviles; Scholar, vicar,
+and cigar, Solar, mica, war and far; One, anemone,
+Balmoral, Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;
+Gertrude, German, wind and mind, Scene, Melpomene,
+mankind. Billet does not rhyme with ballet,
+Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet. Blood and
+flood are not like food, Nor is mould like
+should and would. Viscous, viscount, load
+and broad, Toward, to forward, to reward. And
+your pronunciation's OK When you correctly
+say croquet, Rounded, wounded, grieve and
+sieve, Friend and fiend, alive and live.
+Ivy, privy, famous; clamour And enamour rhyme
+with hammer. River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb, 
+Doll and roll and some and home. Stranger does 
+not rhyme with anger, Neither does devour 
+with clangour. Souls but foul, haunt but aunt, 
+Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant, Shoes,
+goes, does. Now first say finger, And then singer,
+ ginger, linger, Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge 
+and gauge, Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age. 
+Query does not rhyme with very, Nor does fury sound 
+like bury. Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth. 
+Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath. Though the 
+differences seem little, We say actual but victual. 
+Refer does not rhyme with deafer. Foeffer does, and 
+zephyr, heifer. Mint, pint, senate and sedate; 
+Dull, bull, and George ate late. Scenic, Arabic, 
+Pacific, Science, conscience, scientific. Liberty, 
+library, heave and heaven, Rachel, ache, moustache, 
+eleven. We say hallowed, but allowed, People, 
+leopard, towed, but vowed. Mark the differences, 
+moreover, Between mover, cover, clover; Leeches, 
+breeches, wise, precise, Chalice, but police and 
+lice; Camel, constable, unstable, Principle, 
+disciple, label. Petal, panel, and canal, Wait, 
+surprise, plait, promise, pal. Worm and storm, 
+chaise, chaos, chair, Senator, spectator, mayor. 
+Tour, but our and succour, four. Gas, alas, and 
+Arkansas. Sea, idea, Korea, area, Psalm, Maria, 
+but malaria. Youth, south, southern, cleanse and 
+clean. Doctrine, turpentine, marine. Compare 
+alien with Italian, Dandelion and battalion. 
+Sally with ally, yea, ye, Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, 
+and key. Say aver, but ever, fever, Neither, 
+leisure, skein, deceiver. Heron, granary, canary. 
+Crevice and device and aerie. Face, but preface, 
+not efface. Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass. 
+Large, but target, gin, give, verging, Ought, 
+out, joust and scour, scourging. Ear, but earn 
+and wear and tear Do not rhyme with here but ere. 
+Seven is right, but so is even, Hyphen, roughen, 
+nephew Stephen, Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk, Ask, 
+grasp, wasp, and cork and work. Pronunciation 
+(think of Psyche!) Is a paling stout and spikey? 
+Won't it make you lose your wits, Writing groats 
+and saying grits? It's a dark abyss or 
+tunnel: Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, 
+gunwale, Islington and Isle of Wight, Housewife, 
+verdict and indict. Finally, which rhymes with 
+enough, Though, through, plough, or dough, or 
+cough? Hiccough has the sound of cup. 
+My advice is to give up!!!
